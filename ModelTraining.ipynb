      "Nice one... My 2.5 yr old son likes to brush with this flavour- strawberry. Previously I used to use Chicco but switched to this one due to good reviews and lower price.I had used Mee Mee also but this one's ingredients are better for my child's health.\n",
      "My 2 year old child doesn't have cavity but started developing bad breaths the morning after, while using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks during day and night brushing sessions. I feel this toothpaste might actually cause cavity rather than keep it away, from my experience. I immediately shifted back to Pigeon toothpaste for night brushing and the bad breath stopped from the next day onward.  I had purchased it for its all natural properties. Mama Earth team needs to research more on the ingredients on this product. I use other Mama Earth products and they are decent. Not this toothpaste though.\n",
      "Berry flavoured blast that the kids just love!  And the best part is that its perfectly fine if  they swallow it too! Made with 100% safe ingredients, this should be the toothpaste you should introduce your kids to! Mamaearth Berry Blast toothpaste is 100% safe and toxin free. My kids love the Berry taste while brushing. This is one of the best flouride free tooth pastes available for kids that you should be buying right away!\n",
      "Well how much a 12 month old with 4 almost 5 teeth brushes. But this product is good to start eating or tasting rather by baby. that way it is natural and taste good. i applied bit on her teeth thn forgot where i kept it.Buy for your own satisfaction if baby is really small and if understands how to brush and spit or eat than go for it.\n",
      "Pros:1. Natural strawberry flavour.2. SLS & Fluoride free toothpaste.3. 100% vegan.4. Claims to be plastic responsible.Cons:None that I found in the last few months.Verdict:Recommended toothpaste for kids above 1 year. My son likes it. The strawberry flavour is quite noticeable when you're brushing your kid. Wish if this was available as single pack instead of minimum qty as 2 since it takes quite a lot of time to finish the tube when you are taking only a peanut size or less portion for brushingIf you think my review was helpful, don't forget to click the helpful link below the review.\n",
      "Very good product. Reliable and very good quality. My child (4YO) loves it. Earlier he was using Chicco toothpaste. Now loving it. Mamaearth is at par with Chicco in quality yet way economical.\n",
      "I bought it for my 2 years baby. It's mentioned that even if the child gulps it, then also it won't be harmful. Although I am trying my best to teach my little one how to spit out while brushing.I am happy with the product.\n",
      "The important aspect i considered while placing the order was\"its safe, even if swallowed\".Small kids love to brush with it.Its the tooth paste with all safe ingredients.\n",
      "The taste is a bit like mild flavoured bubble gum.... My 2 yr old likes it. Plus it claims to be safe for kids since it is all natural without flouride and SLS (chemical used for foaming).Wish that the quantity was a bit more\n",
      "It is completely natural so I feel safe for my son. Before I used dento shine tooth paste. But this has changed a lott. Just go for it . It safe.\n",

My kids love the Berry taste while brushing. This is one of the best flouride free tooth pastes available for kids that you should be buying right away!\n",
      "Well how much a 12 month old with 4 almost 5 teeth brushes. But this product is good to start eating or tasting rather by baby. that way it is natural and taste good. i applied bit on her teeth thn forgot where i kept it.Buy for your own satisfaction if baby is really small and if understands how to brush and spit or eat than go for it.\n",
      "Pros:1. Natural strawberry flavour.2. SLS & Fluoride free toothpaste.3. 100% vegan.4. Claims to be plastic responsible.Cons:None that I found in the last few months.Verdict:Recommended toothpaste for kids above 1 year. My son likes it. The strawberry flavour is quite noticeable when you're brushing your kid. Wish if this was available as single pack instead of minimum qty as 2 since it takes quite a lot of time to finish the tube when you are taking only a peanut size or less portion for brushingIf you think my review was helpful, don't forget to click the helpful link below the review.\n",
      "Very good product. Reliable and very good quality. My child (4YO) loves it. Earlier he was using Chicco toothpaste. Now loving it. Mamaearth is at par with Chicco in quality yet way economical.\n",
      "I bought it for my 2 years baby. It's mentioned that even if the child gulps it, then also it won't be harmful. Although I am trying my best to teach my little one how to spit out while brushing.I am happy with the product.\n",
      "The important aspect i considered while placing the order was\"its safe, even if swallowed\".Small kids love to brush with it.Its the tooth paste with all safe ingredients.\n",
      "The taste is a bit like mild flavoured bubble gum.... My 2 yr old likes it. Plus it claims to be safe for kids since it is all natural without flouride and SLS (chemical used for foaming).Wish that the quantity was a bit more\n",
      "It is completely natural so I feel safe for my son. Before I used dento shine tooth paste. But this has changed a lott. Just go for it . It safe.\n",
      "Nice one... My 2.5 yr old son likes to brush with this flavour- strawberry. Previously I used to use Chicco but switched to this one due to good reviews and lower price.I had used Mee Mee also but this one's ingredients are better for my child's health.\n",
      "My 2 year old child doesn't have cavity but started developing bad breaths the morning after, while using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks during day and night brushing sessions. I feel this toothpaste might actually cause cavity rather than keep it away, from my experience. I immediately shifted back to Pigeon toothpaste for night brushing and the bad breath stopped from the next day onward.  I had purchased it for its all natural properties. Mama Earth team needs to research more on the ingredients on this product. I use other Mama Earth products and they are decent. Not this toothpaste though.\n",

      "I bought this because I was super impressed with the ingredients list. This one says it's a skin-lighting face wash which I felt so disappointed about at first but then I realised it makes your skin lighter by removing tan from your face. I am really very impressed with the effects. It leaves my skin squeaky clean and makes it brighter. I really love the fragrance of this face wash.\n",
      "It's thick.It has beads and I don't know why they want me to scrub my face off everyday !!!It doesn't foam like a facewash.It smells like pulpy orange while applying and then smells a bit like turmeric after washing off.My face looked bright after using it but not as bright as my previous facewashes.Made my skin dry. It was annoying since my skin was already dry without it and it made it worse !It is definitely not worth the money ( I got it for 175rs in a sale.  Still isn't worth it )I don't think it worked on my tan. I still dont see any changes in skin.It's disappointing !!!!\n",
      "So this is one such facewash free from parabens and sulfate, hence made me order it. Talking about the natural ingredients like turmeric and liquorice extract attracted it more.

Best for people who wants to get rid of tanning, discoloration and pigmentation.\n",

      "Frankly I have ordered this product after seeing so many good reviews..and here is my honest review after using for about 15 days--Does not break my skin- feel light and mositurized- does nothing for my marks or uneven toneSo, the purpose of fading marks or making glowing skin is not at all entertained so far.Yet I want to wait till 1 bottle use. Can be used as light mositurising serum for upcoming summers. Hopes it helps!\n",
      "Mamaearth's face serum it's just very amazing. I have tried so many products for my face pigmentation problem but this product is superb. Due to this product my pigmentation problem is resolved plus my skin qulaity is improved. It comes with vitamin C which is very essential for healthy skin. So happy to come across this product , superb happy with my glowing skin. I sure trying this product one won't switch to another.\n",
      "Fast absorbing & non-greasy Face Serum, Turmeric properties works well for radiant skin and Vitamin C antioxidant properties supporting it very well with reducing acne/dark spots. Using it from the last 15 days and so far it's really working well for me, Can't say about actual result so soon need to wait at least 15-20 days more to check actual results on Face Brightens and Fine Lines Reduction.\n",
      "I ordered this serum on the recommendation of my very dear friend. The serum comes in a small pump type packaging. After a week of use i can tell that the procuct is effective. The serum keeps the skin hydrated and blooming. The serum provides radiance to the skin thus compatible with every skin tone. It doesnt make your face fairer but it definitely provides glow to the skin. The product is worth a try.\n",
      "Um the product is really not for people with sensitive skin. I read good reviews on Amazon and ordered it (I was using vitamin c products from other brands which are really expensive so I thought I could give this a try since this is very affordable). But within a week of use I started breaking out all over my face, the big zits kind. I had to stop using within a week of its use. May be the product works for non-sensitive skin, product is really light, can’t tell if it gives any kind of moisture to the skin. I had to change my entire skin care routine, bought my tried and tested organic products and my skin is much much better. I don’t trust mamaearth any more.\n",
      "It may not suit everyone may be. I had high expectations from this..my skin isn't acne prone and I had smooth skin before I used it. I just started using it just for the sake of extra glow but it turned out opposite for me. I used it 3 days n now stopped as I got small white acne on forehead n on nose u can check the picture. N what I'm worried about it I got a small white patch under my eyes the 3rd day. M horrified n won't use it and don't recommend this to everyone. I wasted my 500 bucks!!\n",
      "I was really hoping that this serum will be as good as the mcaffeine face serum.....But after using 1whole bottle of it.....I really can't see any visible changes on my skin.....It didn't reduced my pigmentation....And it is really very liquidy in consistency that it dries out my skin.....I have to apply a moisturizer after using this serum. Well it didn't worked for me at all.....Wasted 😢\n",
      "Waste of money. Do not buy . No results.\n",
      "Just go for it. Before I started using it I had spots on my face from breakouts and uneven skintone it's been around 15 days since I started using it and I have noticed spots are lighter than before and I can see my skintone getting even than before. Its easily observe in the skin within a minute.The only downside is it's smell but it's not pungent or discomforting one.\n",
      "I bought it for my mom as she was having problems related to her skin like hyperpigmentation. Being in her 50s she has a well managed diet plan and routine. The package delivered was suitable and fine look wise. But, after applying on face for a week, her forehead started to develop rashes accompanied by itchiness. She had to literally stop it and wait till it heals which took  more than two weeks. Personally I would not recommend this product to any of the ladies out there. It's just a waste of money and time. And ofcourse, I won't get a refund or payback. I am surely disappointed, dissatisfied, and annoyed.\n",
      "Frankly I have ordered this product after seeing so many good reviews..and here is my honest review after using for about 15 days--Does not break my skin- feel light and mositurized- does nothing for my marks or uneven toneSo, the purpose of fading marks or making glowing skin is not at all entertained so far.Yet I want to wait till 1 bottle use. Can be used as light mositurising serum for upcoming summers. Hopes it helps!\n",
      "Mamaearth's face serum it's just very amazing. I have tried so many products for my face pigmentation problem but this product is superb. Due to this product my pigmentation problem is resolved plus my skin qulaity is improved. It comes with vitamin C which is very essential for healthy skin. So happy to come across this product , superb happy with my glowing skin. I sure trying this product one won't switch to another.\n",
      "Fast absorbing & non-greasy Face Serum, Turmeric properties works well for radiant skin and Vitamin C antioxidant properties supporting it very well with reducing acne/dark spots. Using it from the last 15 days and so far it's really working well for me, Can't say about actual result so soon need to wait at least 15-20 days more to check actual results on Face Brightens and Fine Lines Reduction.\n",
      "I ordered this serum on the recommendation of my very dear friend. The serum comes in a small pump type packaging. After a week of use i can tell that the procuct is effective. The serum keeps the skin hydrated and blooming. The serum provides radiance to the skin thus compatible with every skin tone. It doesnt make your face fairer but it definitely provides glow to the skin. The product is worth a try.\n",

      "I have oily acne prone skin and have been using this product for a few days now. My acne has dried out but I do not see a significant improvement in dark spots yet. The fragrance is mild so brilliant! I'll continue using this as it helped my acne. Just a tip to all people with acne skin. Keep your scalp clean and change your pillow sheets. It really helps.\n",
      "I have been using this product for 1yr.but the product i received have a diffrent smell and consistency...i doubt it is the original product..!!and it is only 30ml...the usual is 50ml\n",
      "My most fav go to cream for blemishes. Nothing was helping me.much to get rid of my blemishes and I started using it ...I felt the difference very quickly but after sometime I thought it stopped working so I stopped using but I realized it was working only when I stopped using it. It made a huge difference . M not stopping it now.\n",
      "I have hyperpigmentation , have been using this cream since 1 week , my hyperpigmentation has bee reduce to an extent . Will update you in few months 🙂👍🏻\n",
      "Here is an honest review... please think twice before buying this product... instead of removing pimples...there was pimples all over my face\n",
      "Mamaearth products are made of 100%  natural ingredients which contain mulberry extract and vitamin C.MulBerry extract is used to treat hyperpigmentation and vitamin C heals in sun damage and repairs damaged skin cells.It suits all skin types .It is free from mineral oil and paraben.It reduces dark spots,blemishes and controls melanin.It has  a pump dispenser which is great for travelling. Can be used as a moisturiser.\n",
      "Hello everyone, Please buy this product only if you are looking for \"Moisturizer\" .This works as a great moisturizer and it does the job what it claims for but not 100%.Iam writing this review after 1 month of usage and realised that this is a product where 30ml  isn't available in original website of \"Mamaearth , I  figured out only after purchasing 50 ml from original website of Mamaearth.Ingredients: If you compare the ingredients of 30ml and 50ml : 30ml contains all the chemicals and 50ml consists of all the essential oils which is great.Scent: 30ml bottle has great smell coz all the chemicals are added.50ml bottle has the smell of essential oils which most of them might not like it( Hardly any chemical is added)This I figured out after using the 30ml which I purchased from Amazon and I used it exactly for 1 month and bottle got over, then I was looking to buy another one and I went to Mamaearth original site and figured out this .I would recommend you to compare the ingredients before you buy this from Amazon\n",
      "The ingredients list in 30ml bottle are completely different from 50ml bottle.. more chemicals present in 30ml pack. The cream smells like antiseptic/chemical cream. In 50ml cream u ll find essential oils in the ingredients list but in 30ml you will find chemicals list.. totally it's waste of money.\n",
      "So I am a big fan of MAMA EARTH products and I generally places order from Nykaa. This time thought of giving a try to Amazon. But I am highly disappointed by the product. It seems like a copied product of the original mama earth. The scent is bad and this cream broke me out badly. It is not like the original product. You don't expect this from a product which is on a pricier side.\n",

      "I am writing this review after using it around 20 days. It seems very natural and chemical free and is very gentle on skin. But it does its job of cleaning the skin properly. It contains tea tree which is one of my favourite ingredients for skin care. Give it a try... its definitely better than all other chemicals containing face washes.And its even affordable as compared to other natural brands available in market.\n",
      "Though it is pricey but quality comes at a price. It is free of chemicals so a healthy option for skin. Gives results on acne prone face in 7-8 days. Cleanses face very well and quantity required is also less. This will b my face wash for years to come.\n",
      "This face wash is amazing guys. I've oily skin. Every now and then my face breaks out. But when I first time used this within 4 wash my pimples were gone! I'm not jocking guys. This face wash does wonders. I use it two times daily, after waking up in the morning and before going to bed. Now I'm using it for two months. And I don't  a single pimple past two months. For every oily skin acne prone beauties I'll recommend this facewash.\n",
      "I have oily to combination skin. During Monsoons, my skin becomes even oilier due to humidity and also it becomes more prone to breakouts. I have been using this face wash for quite some time now and it works amazing on my skin. It extracts the excess oil from my skin and leaves it clean but not dehydrated. Also, I haven't faced any breakout on my face since I've started using it.\n",
      "Caused too much pimples on dry and sensitive skin. Would recommend VLCC for such skin type as it doesn't atleast have any side effects. Very disappointed by Mamaearth. Had a hell a lot of expectations.\n",
      "I really love services of amazon their delivery their return policy their  packing.Their service towards their customers its applicable.Now product- 3.5 star  Average plus product. odour of the material i didn't like. It smells like medicated facewash. I dont know whether it fights with acne or pimple. I wasn't having any pimple or acne issues but only for concern i switched to herbal facewash and first i picked aroma magic tea tree oil face which was good i applied it on my face for several months but suddenly some acne and pimple attack on my face i didn't know the cause and then i switched to mamaearth face wash but it did nothing on my face used it for 15 days no result i got. Both the product were fail to cure my pimple or acneI don't know what kind of pimple attack it was. only two or three pimple used to occur after healing that again two or three. OMG finally i consulted to doctor.Both the product i purchased with recommandation of fit tuber on YouTube.If your face is free of pimples or acne then you can use these products by replacing chemical products. But if you're suffering from pimples or acne i dont know both the facewashes will work or not. Because everybody has their own skin and their own causes of occuring pimples or acnes.You can buy and try.\n",

The facewash is clear like a gel and have tea tree fragrance. it really helps fighting acne and in almost two uses, my mother was really impressed. A must buy for anyone fighting acne.\n",
      "I m editing this review on 11/5/2020, my experience with this product is so disappointing.its quality is lower than regular soap , for any skin type I don't recommend to buy this, not worth for money, it just clean your face with water that's all it do, it's a scam, I bought this product after watching fit YouTubber channel, and I wasted my money; I say don't go after product that says it's natural it's a big scam , not only they don't work on you but they come very very expensive , I use home remedies and some regular Market product.\n",
      "I have sensitive and acne prone skin. More than active acne i have scars on my face. This face wash shows visible results after 1 usage only.

      "I m editing this review on 11/5/2020, my experience with this product is so disappointing.its quality is lower than regular soap , for any skin type I don't recommend to buy this, not worth for money, it just clean your face with water that's all it do, it's a scam, I bought this product after watching fit YouTubber channel, and I wasted my money; I say don't go after product that says it's natural it's a big scam , not only they don't work on you but they come very very expensive , I use home remedies and some regular Market product.\n",
      "I have sensitive and acne prone skin. More than active acne i have scars on my face. This face wash shows visible results after 1 usage only. It is very gentle on skin, has a pleasant and mild fragrance. Does not rip off the natural oil from your face, leaves your face deeply cleansed and smooth after wash. It is complete value for money\n",
      "Mamaearth is always best.  Every product of this brand is awesome.  I love all babies products by Mamaearth. Best part of this soap is SUITABLE FOR EVERY BABY'S DELICATE SKIN even you can try it for your newborns as well.  I'm using it for my baby since birth. Quality same as mentioned. The natural nutrients present in goat milk gets easily absorbed in the delicate skin of your baby and keeps it moisturized for long time.SUITS DRY, ITCHY, ECZEMA PRONE SKIN as well.  Best product. You can purchase it for your baby or for gifting for your loved ones.\n",
      "Update: horrible bathing that I have used so far... My 3 year old son developed hives after using the soap and more over it turned him dark... Fragrance too strong... It literally hits you.. Will never buy again...The bar is ok ok... Not so good as it claims.... I used on my kid and feel it doesn't cleanse well.  I have a dry skin... I used for myself on face and found that my skin is still dry after washing... So nothing great about the moisturising part and more over I don't feel fresh after washing my face with this bar... Its like I haven't washed my face.  So I really doubt if it cleanses ur skin.\n",
      "Although, it makes a very rich and creamy lather, it starts melting quickly if kept wet. I need to take it out of the bathroom and dry it for the next use as I want to save as much of it as possible because it's costlier than other brands. But, it does a far better job than other brands and it's organic. I'm happy to have this soap in my skincare regimen as an adult who has a very sensitive skin prone to irritation. The best thing about this soap is it doesn't leave any residue, which I'm surprised to see. Other brands leave a thin film which makes skin feel very slippery and smooth and I don't like that. I want my skin to feel naked, fresh and not stripped with moisture. Mamaearth soap as well as the mamaearth baby wash did an excellent job. :)\n",
      "Very bad product worth ZERO star. The entire soap turn into a pasty mass after one time use. Not worth buying this product as the second day onwards one has to scoop it with hand like a cream and apply on baby. Bad manufacturing process for this soap. Better they market it in the form of liquid body wash. Moreover, the soapy feel doesn't go from the body on few rinse. Worst than Teddy bar which has similar outcome, but better than this. Dermadew found to best on my trials to find a good soap for my baby.\n",
      "I avoided the previous negative reviews for this item and trusted mama earth brand but I'm sharing this review after 2 weeks of use. On 1st day itself I got rashes on my skin but I ignored it. Later on my whole face got rashes and small boils. My skin became too dry and spotty. I used it with mama earth baby cream still my skin was drying out giving me many burns on face. I stopped using this item and continued my cetaphil cleansing lotion. I will never use mama earth's any product again. I threw away the soaps and moisturizer.\n",
      "I really have started appreciating this brand as the product they made really works well and best part is they are made from safe ingredients. This baby soap is been enriched with goodness  goat milk, oatmeal, Shea butter and coconut based cleanser. The skin of my toddler feels so soft after bath. The shape of the soap is perfect for little one to hold as well. No tears formula of soap is working great. It is very gentle on the skin. The fragrance is so amazing. I highly recommend this moisturizing bath to all mommies and daddies. I specially recommend it for toddlers who are in phase where they want to be independent and bath by themselves.\n",
      "Everytime I used to search baby soap when one going to finish.this time I heard about mamaearth baby soap.lets try but it's been a week i am using it for my daughter.now I think my search now going to be ended.it is very mild which is good for baby skin\n",
      "A gentle cleansing soap that doesn't dry out skin and leaves a lingering baby fragrance after use. Yet another fabulous stellar product by Mamaearth,  makes a  perfect gift for a baby hamper too.\n",
      "The soap is really good and I really appreciate its quality. It leaves baby's skin soft, moisturized and doesn't dry it out at all. However, only after 2 days of use, the soap became a lump of cream and I literally have to keep it in a bowl and scoop out little at a time, like cream to use it. Mamaearth please do something about it without compromising on the quality.\n",
      "The soap is creamy and less foamy which means it is sulfate free and has fresh coconut fragrance . You will feel the difference in your babys skin the day you start using it. The packaging is Excellent!!! I give it more than five starts\n",

      "the quality that godrej is delivering is top notch. I previously used lifebuoy, dettol, santoor even patanjali also. but this product is something different. the smell is very good and the clear gel is also very gentle to the hands\n",
      "Very nice hand wash. I have used most of the brands available in the market and by far this is the best. It's so mild on your hands and does it's job of cleaning well. This is the first time I have used the master blaster, I have been a big fan of their masterchef's hand wash ( different variant ).\n",
      "The scent and feel of the hand wash seems different from earlier ones as I have been using this brand purechased from  Amazon dealers only since last six months. My impression after first use was it being inferior or not genuine product. As it came from Cloudtrail I do not doubt it but still there is something wrong with this supply.\n",
      "The fragrance that is left behind using the green color product makes you feel in heaven while this wants to run to hell and stay there. This product needs a better smell for this particular blue liquid handwash. I feel like I am in a hospital every time I wash my hands with it.\n",
      "Firstly thanks to Amazon for \"Delivering Essential Items\" during the lockdown in \"Red Zones\" as it is impossible to think of online product deliveries  in the current situation.No issues with the product 👍😊\n",
      "This handwash gives a mild scent and very good on pocket. A little liquid spreads well and lathers up well to clean hands efficiently. The reduced MRP makes it more affordable and an added gain. One of the first products in our most essential lists.\n",
      "I always used Dettol handwash, pink one, that's always better for me.But after using this, I personally feel that it is soften than Dettol handwash.Smell is also better, and foam development is better than Dettol.\n",
      "Purchased 2 packs of 750ml each but surprised to see 1 full pack of 750ml filled into my pump dispenser of 650 ml capacity. To be noted my dispenser is an empty bottle of pantene shampoo having standard capacity. Sure about less volume of hand waah. One pack is still intact with its seal. You may check it any time within a month.\n",

      "Godrej No. 1 is one of those soaps that has been able to balance all the essential tick points in a common bath soap viz pleasant fragrance, good lather, soft on the skin (I use this during Delhi winters and while some soaps leads to skin drying, Godrej No. 1 leaves the skin soft and moisturized) and economical.I personally love the Lime fragrance but all the other ones are good too and it boils down to an individual preference.

Before buy this I verify the price with local and also Godrej shop's the price of this product is 21600 rupee but in amazon I get this in 16k. So my suggestion never buy the product from local shops if you do that then you also pay the extra money for toli vara and delivery charges might be they can give you some extra ice tray but still amazon is best. Here some pros and cons I providePros : Beautyfull Colorfull look, direct cool,  large vegetables rack.

      "Product was looking same as it showed in the picture but I am totally disappointed with delivery services, It took 21 days to deliver at my address in damage condition.I would like to replace if it will done within very short of time .\n",
      "Got damaged itemNot supportive and fast actions taken!\n",
      "Simply awesome...!Spacious, looks good, No issues as of now. If you are thinking about getting it.. well just go for it...! 👍👌\n",
      "After using 7 days reviewing ...Pros :1. Godrej ....superb  ultimately made in india product. Indian brand.2. Low power consumption, 5 Star rated energy saving. Reduce electicity bill.Cons :1. Orderd refrigerator with base drawer, for that ₹ 1000/- spend more. Quality of base drawer plastic is very much poor .2. Ice tray is also very small , and quality of plastic not good .Overall value for money ...\n",
      "+No damage upon deliveryCooling is goodNot noisyAmple space for family of 3-4Good lookDry storage is nice.-Door doesnt close on its own, need to push itGlasswares are very delicate (big factor)Water removal cabinet wierdly placedOnly 1 ice cube tray provided\n",
      "Very fuel efficiency is observed, since the date of usage of the product! Very spacious and functioning with minimal sound!👌 This Refrigerator is worth enough to be recommended to a small family in a budget price range!👍😊\n",
      "I did exchange with BEST Price in the market and everything went well, no doubt about that, In fact, Product delivered on promised date,  and the quality is too good.\n",
      "I've been using this Godrej aer pocket for a couple of years now. Yes I understand that the fragrance doesn't last for more than a week. It is very strong the first couple of days and rest of the times it is just a light hint of the scent. Then the gel eventually crystallizes.I figured out a way for a 'juggad'. Basically I never take the gel pack out of the plastic cover. There is a hole at the top to hang individual packs for store displays that I cut. Then with scissors, I carefully make 3 slender cuts. This makes the scent come out soft and not too powerful. It lasts for almost 20 days this way. The violet fragrance (purple) lasts for 25 days with this.Hope this review is helpful.\n",
      "These champs are better considering they are way to different from the Odonil fresheners we have been using for ages (it's basic law of diminishing returns) I'll encourage you to try them for their fragrance, and they are apt for any room in your apartment. When newly opened the fragrance is too strong that i would kick you in the face with it, but it dissolves when you give it a couple of days.Another good part about this is the concept of hanging it, I usually do in the fall ceiling of my washrooms, and it works pretty well.Word of caution: Don't expect it to last a month, because mine never have. Maximum 20 to 22 days, and then you'll want to replace it with a new one, but if you grab it on a deal on Amazon Pantry, it's quite economical\n",
      "Used this product.fragrance is excellent and of my liking. Very effective for closed spaces including car, toilet, bathroom, offices etc. Easy to install so no zanzat. Fragrance lasts roughly fifteen days, but during this period it should please you and your guests.\n",
      "Seems duplicate product as the fragrance has faded after 5 days of use. Amazon authorities please do a check with supplier of this product,I think now I cannot return the item as I hv opened the packet,but how a buyer can be sure about the product without using the item??I think this can be a fit case to be filed with consumer forum.Buyers DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.SUNIL\n",
      "On each box the MRP is mentioned as rs 160 , for pack of 3 packs it become rs480 but they are selling at rs495 for 3 boxes ,Kindly take a action against this\n",
      "I am overall happy with this product. But if you want to maintain freshness in your toilet area make sure you buy little more quantities of this product as it doesn't last very longer in my frank opinion. No complaints about fragrance. You would surely love it. So go check this out. Very Good product. It wouldn't disappoint you.\n",
      "The smell did not last for a week also. It was strong on the first day. After that one couldn't make out the presence of this product at all.\n",
      "I think one the best product I have used...It just freshens ur mood... Better than its odonil counterparts... The scent spreads evenly.. just go for it..\n",
      "Some of the packet looks like they have leaked and it is wet all over when you open the seal.  The fragrance does not last for 30 days.  It starts off with very strong smell and within a week it just fades.\n",
      "The misty had kind of a soapy smell but works. Smell is pleasant but hardly you would know about the smell unless you get close to it. The citrus has a sort of tangy smell but i find it better than the misty. Will have to try the violet. Initial days your room will be filled with the pleasant smell but a packet  lasts only for like 14 days. In the latter days you will completely forget about it. If you have the shell to spend then go for it.\n",

      "To start off, the safe arrived with a Low Battery message, meaning that before I could do anything else, I had to go and get new batteries for this brand new item. Once you get things in order, the safe works well and serves its purpose, however, the manual provided is obsolete, and the instructions do not match up with this product. There are no solutions posted online either. If you want to program the safe, you have to figure it out on your own. The customer service personnel were not helpful either and they kept trying to force me to get a technician to come to my house at the cost of Rs. 500 just to program the device, which completely defeats the purpose of online shopping. Don't fall for it. This is rather ridiculous for such a big brand like Godrej.In case anyone else needs to re-program their home code, here is what I was able to do. I hope it works for you too:1.) The instructions indicate to press 68#, but it actually means 68(Lock). If the instructions indicate *, try pressing Clear2.) Every time I pressed 68#, I got an error message, so I had to go through all the steps listed below.3.) Before you can change personal code in home mode, you will need to Access The Programming (pg. 6). The code is 751019 which means that there are 6 different features that you can program. Go through all the steps and change the numbers as they suit you. When you get to the last digit, there are no instructions written in the book, so you will have to figure this out on your own. If the last digit is 1, change it to 0 or 9.4.) After going through the programming and changing the last number, you should be able to go back to change the personal code in home mode.5.)

But starting it for the first time took me several hours to start and install it properly.Here I will list out all steps so that reading this other people might find it helpful.1. Unwrap the package properly. Look for any damages.2. You will find a set of keys attached in a plastic sachet.3. Use the key to open the locker. There is a white cover near the button panel ,open it to insert keys.4. Inside the locker you will find the manual and wall mounting knots.5.

Close the battery lid and led will automatically start working. The battery lid needs a small screw to get fixed. so if u don't find the screw in any plastic packets then use another aftermarket screws or maybe the screw is present inside the locker mechanism.7. The locker mechanism screws can be unlocked by a particular opener which will be given with the mounting knots inside the locker.8. The locker is now ready to use.

      "How to set new password in home mode , there is no # key as mentioned in manual. Idot seller and supplier.Double click clear button- enter 751019-enter 171310- press lock three times- enter new password -enter lock .done new password is setIt is good safe\n",
      "First it is made in China product which I was not expecting from Godrej.The safe arrived with dent and chipped paint at two places.manual with the product is obsolete.Instruction indicating 68# to program the lock but there is no # key on key pad, door was not align.Totally dissatisfied with the product quality.\n",
      "The reason I declined the purchase was that it was to light.A thief can easily take it and open it in their own sweet time.Therefore I declined the purchase\n",
      "Good product and provides good security. Provides a master pwd which can be used even if we forget regular pwd.Executive has provided DEMO on time after taking appointment by calling customer care. Charged 300/- for demo & installation.\n",
      "I love this digital safe locker. Now I can put all my important stuff inside this box. The good thing is that it is not that bulky. The material is also very good, seems very strong and heavy. And, It is very easy to install. I have not mounted/fixed it because I put this inside the almera. Now I can feel safer by keeping cash, passport and other valuable stuff.Lookwise also it just has a classy touch. It has a proper colored LED display. It works on the battery power and the consumption is very low. You can set your own passcode from the 4-8 digits. I like it beep sound whenever you have to press the keys. In addition it also has 2 emergency keys. Overall now I am very calm ever since this digital safe has been arrived. Of course now I can manage my things for my own peace of mind according to my needs :-).Earlier I never ever used such kind of digital safe but after have been started using  this I found this as exactly as what I expected for. Truly it's a big value for money. I would highly recommend this product to everyone who read this review. Greets!*Please click the Helpful button if you like this review. Thank you!\n",
      "Very bad product. The code doesn’t work suddenly. Trying to open it with override key n it won’t open. Tried calling the customer care n they say, I will be charged Rs.500 for the technician visit. It is only 2 months I bought it. Very bad product.\n",
      "Highly dissatisfied with the product. Received in package opened condition. Perfume bottle was almost empty. Though it was specified as returnable, but return not accepted. Finally it's defective one as it's not spraying after 10 mins, only the green light blinking and not starting spray even after 10 hrs. They say it's so designed. Ridiculous I think. Moreover I bought। Another bottle of fragrance but it's emptied within 2/3 days and 2/3 hrs a day of use. Though it was said to last 20000 sprays. That's the product.\n",
      "The smell is good but the arrmatic spray is not functioning properly. I have airwick also and airwick aermatic sprayers are excellent. Use Godrej refills with airwick sprayers. They fit perfectly\n",
      "Money wasted. The product does not work properly.  It sprayed 4-5 times, making me dispose the bill and box and it stopped working from next day. I had used Air Wick earlier and that worked perfectly. Avoid this product and from the seller as he may be clearing his defect stock.\n",
      "I really liked this product at first. I also loved the fragrance of lavender. But after 2 months, the motor stopped pressing the refill hard enough and the fragrance stopped. I changed the batteries but it was of no use. I even got Duracell batteries. It's of no use. The motor is not strong enough. Bad experience.\n",
      "Really disappointed with this product. It’s not even a month and this product is spraying continuously within seconds. I tried setting the timer on 10,20 and 40min intervals but it sprays within seconds. Can’t even return the product now because it is out of return window. The fragnance is pretty good but can’t believe that the machinery of this product have timer issues in just less than a month of use. Totally not recommended if you are bot looking to buy this product every month.\n",
      "Godrej failed to deliver the quality i expected , perfume of the spray lasted for just 10 days and after 10 day's only gas was coming out from the refill and smell of the perfume was very less ,so i am not getting any kind of perfume  smell in my room  , don't buy it i also wrote a complaint to godrej consumer products regarding this issue of selling me inferior quality product which does not meets their reputation\n",
      "Worst product. Product is not working after 10days.\n",
      "I have been ordering from cloudtail from a long time and I am not writing this for them...this is for the product which is a crap I have to take out the batteries and re put them everyday as the spray is not working and it’s just been 2 weeks of placing the product on wall..\n",
      "It’s not working the spray point is getting pressed but it’s not functioning no spray out of it automatically.... unnecessarily I ordered the auto machine which is not as said at all... n I think it’s already a fault piece cos the cartoon of this product was also not perfect\n",
      "Recieved defective product and no option for replacement, simply waste if money.Seller and amazon should take responsibility for defective product as how can customer responsible for defective product received.CrapLooklike amazon cheating customer by putting crap rules and we don't find time to run behind consumer forum and amazon is taking advantage over the same\n",

      "The product was defective. The front keypad panel was not sitting properly. Same was immediately observed on receiving and opening the product. The defect was reported and Amazon has arranged a replacement. Have  informed Amazon to check and confirm that the product resent  is not defective and in order\n",
      "The product is good. The only caveat (as I have noticed so far) is to be careful with the alarm. Don't keep stuff on it after switching the alarm on. Second, I think the alarm tone itself should change. It needs to be ALARMING. The volume needs to be a bit on the higher side as well. One can easily muffle the sound with a blanket type of fabric and make a getaway. That said, it is quite a sleek gadget. Definitely worth more than what one would be paying for. It's a bit heavy, but I guess that needs to be part of the \"package\" so to speak.\n",
      "This is very handy and useful. I keep it inside my wardrobe and store my wallet, car key and other loose currency and change in it when I come back from office. So no more  carelessly placed wallet risking small stealing by maid. As I got the wardrobe made recently, I got a specially designed compartment to keep this safe. It works flawlessly and is very easy to operate.  If I want to lock all the other wardrobes at home while going out somewhere, I keep the keys inside this.  no need to carry so many keys with me. One needs to know the purpose of this safe and the way to use it.\n",
      "Using it since November 2016.Sleek and elegant. Sits nicely in my cupboard.Useful to keep certain small sized valuables like keys,cash,jewelry,certain documents,watches etc.The touch panel is great, feels soft and is responsive.Velvet lining is great.Portable.Only con I found is that it buzzez even if you close the cupboard door a bit hard.Other than that, Its good to have it.Note: Its not a regular heavy duty safe. Its more of a personal locker as mentioned. Don't expect it to be the most secure thing you can have.\n",
      "Bought godrej goldilock in the Amazon diwali sale.. In The product that I got,was having some scratches already. Still I kept it.  I wanted to disable the theft alarm because it gives a loud sound even if we move the goldilock slightly, which is very annoying. I tried to disable the feature but it was not getting disabled. The godrej executive also couldn't do it.. He told some problem is there in pcb and I should return the product.. I did it.. I got the product replaced by Amazon the very next day...Now the new product also has same problem. We cannot disable the alarm. Also it has one additional problem...when we close its lid, it sometimes doesn't get locked. After 2-3 attempts, it gets locked..Now I am confused, what to do with this.. I trusted godrej brand and Amazon.. But the satisfaction level is not at all there\n",
      "Awesome packaging done by amazon !!Product review:Pros: 1.Easy to Carry  2.Touch screen is absolutely smooth.  3.Working mini safe with a primitive touch screen run by a 9 volt battery..well that is awesome.  4.Developers and Designers have done a great job in creating a sleek and stylish safe.Cons:  1.Although the safe looks great..not much space to place enough valuables.If u place a mobile,wallet and a wristwatch..space is done for.  2.Inner layer of the safe is made by a grossest material.It's so rough that it can scratch the back side of your iphone if haven't placed carefully.  3.Wiring for this safe can be done better.  4.Default battery provided to you will be a GP 9 volt alkaline battery,Mine was pretty much messySo to sum this up,a fine product for occasional use (routine if you are thrifty enough to spend bucks on batteries) with a stylish look ✌🏻\n",
      "I recently gifted this item to my parents on their anniversary. However the product is good and easy to use with a very responsive touch panel , it has to be absolutely stationary else the alarm sets off which makes it difficult to carry during transportation.Also the Godrej support team is not quick in answering your queries and I received a product which had few scratches on it. So, Amazon should ensure that the product appears brand new since the customers are paying them for a brand new product.  Overall it's worth buying for your security needs.\n",
      "Product Is Excellent but the packaging was really terrible, I was shocked to see the box damaged like it was thrown in the warehouse or something, luckily the product was in mint condition.The locker is very very useful when you have domestic help around, this locker shall actually keep you stress free, the locker is very easy to operate during day or night due to led backlit number which are illuminated, overall a great buy wish Amazon improves the packaging on this product in the future.....\n",
      "If you have maids in the house and want to keep valuables like wallets and regular use small jewellery under lock and key while they go about their household chores and you don't want to carry physical keys either for fear of misplacing and searching for them or simply inconvenient for you, then this is the product to go for. It's small enough to sit on your study table or fit in your cupboard drawer..although you must understand That it can't fit more than 3 or 4 regular size men's wallets and some other knickknacks like ear rings, chains, cards etc. Easy to operate and install by reading instructions in manual. Sturdy enough to dissuade servants from physical tampering. Serves purpose for what it is intended to do.\n",

      "The watch looks superb. Excellent finish. You get exactly what you see in the photos. Product rating is 5 star.BUT i dont think the seller , Cloudtail , handled the product properly. When i opened the box, to my disappointment i found the thin plastic that covers a new watch glass face is all crumpled up to a corner. I was scared thinking the glass face must be damaged, but thank God it wasnt the case. Also there's no dealer stamp in the warranty card.My take: if you really like what you see, go for it. And if you are scared to buy online then buy it from the brick mortar shops, cause its worth it.\n",

The box is made up of cardboard and the watch was already outside the box when delivered. Thankfully, it wasn't damaged.When I received the watch, it wasn't working, so I had to change the cell myself.The watch looks good and straps are sturdy enough.So if I had to rate,Delivery 4 starsThe product 4 starsPackaging 1 star\n",
      "I don't have the photo of the watch to upload but believe me, the best watch your money can buy. It looks much better than it is shown in Amazon picture. Trust me go for it.

      "The watch looks superb. Excellent finish. You get exactly what you see in the photos. Product rating is 5 star.BUT i dont think the seller , Cloudtail , handled the product properly. When i opened the box, to my disappointment i found the thin plastic that covers a new watch glass face is all crumpled up to a corner. I was scared thinking the glass face must be damaged, but thank God it wasnt the case. Also there's no dealer stamp in the warranty card.My take: if you really like what you see, go for it. And if you are scared to buy online then buy it from the brick mortar shops, cause its worth it.\n",
      "Very nice ,fast delivery, I like it\n",
      "Awesome watch. Love this product in this price\n",
      "The product is almost similar to the actual one.. But the day and date cycle not working properly.. And the week names are wrong.. Like Sunday written as SAB, MRI, and so on\n",
      "Good one .but date is wrongly represented\n",
      "I bought the watch for my father.Thank you Amazon for delivering it before the delivery date!The packaging, however; was bad. The box is made up of cardboard and the watch was already outside the box when delivered. Thankfully, it wasn't damaged.When I received the watch, it wasn't working, so I had to change the cell myself.The watch looks good and straps are sturdy enough.So if I had to rate,Delivery 4 starsThe product 4 starsPackaging 1 star\n",
      "I don't have the photo of the watch to upload but believe me, the best watch your money can buy. It looks much better than it is shown in Amazon picture. Trust me go for it. No problem nothing, it went on ticking at one shot. For day setting, one is written in spanish and also in english. Date also accurate.\n",
      "Nice product\n",

      "Got it to gift a groom at his wedding. Beautiful timepiece. In fact I loved it do much I'm getting one for myself. The black dial and the silver hands and silver marking makes the functioning of the watch look stunning and royal. Dial size is just right. It is definitely not small and it is not very big either. It looks very well balanced on the wrist. And the metal bracelet that comes with it is beautiful and goes perfectly with the timepiece dimension wise and there's no mismatch between them. Go for it without any second guessing. You'll love it ❤️ Thank you Amazon and thank you Titan. Both amazing companies and now you both have a very very happy and loyal customer in me for life.\n",

Recently I decided to get a watch myself and after thorough browsing I chose to buy this one. The dial is small and doesn't look odd on small wrists. But the chain strap should have been more elegant and thee locking system shld have been easy. All in all this watch didn't disappoint me.\n",

      "Amul Paneer is probably the best paneer that you can get in the market. If you get it fresh (which I did) then it has the right consistency, feel and taste. Nothing beats Amul.\n",
      "Well, Amul product is nice n trustworthy but only point is that this product was delivered to us when it was reaching about its expiry date\n",
      "Amul panner was good, but found Nandini (KMF) panner was more goid/tasty\n",
      "It is not good quality, it is very hard paneer\n",
      "Bitterresssssssstttt of all...Tastes bitter. No sugarhaving a piece of it. I ordered 4. Will finish it in 4 months time.Eat it as a medicine. Only for dark chocolate loversLots of minerals in it.Good source of antioxidants. Lowers bad cholesterols. Numerous benefits Google it friends.Good for heart and high BP and diebetic patients. I give it to my father (60) also.May work as an antidepressant too.Not a sweetner. But  a nutrient rich food.First 2-3 days it was difficult to eat but now its good. After all health is wealth.Great work Amul #FIT INDIA MOVEMENTDo not discontinue production this chocolate AMUL like you did for 90% cocoa. Retain this as your permanent product. Please give micronutrients information also in the chocolate.\n",
      "All the chocolate lovers will love this chocolate! (P.S. I said chocolate lovers not sugar lovers.). It's absolutely one of the best dark chocolates in India. You can go for it only if you are a die hard fan of cocoa! Order delivered was absolutely fresh and was in the finest state.\n",
      "Chocolate didn't melt in transit to Bhubaneswar( doesn't melt in transit to Bengaluru either).I love dark chocolate and can eat comfortably till Amul 90%, so wanted to try the ultimate 99% but found it a little too bitter for my taste so now I use it to make hot chocolate and it tastes much better than Hershey's. Just chop this chocolate into small pieces and stir it in your milk!\n",
      "Bitter is a very silple word, need some terrible word to describe this, i don't think i can go beyond 70% cocao... now i don't know what i will do with two bars.... on a lighter note: guys think twice before ordering, this is some 3rd degree torture not for general public use, might help military to torture terrorists. If i was a terrorist i would speak out everything after eating this in return of sugar..Jokes apart guys this is best and cheapest you can get, well done,  amul really the taste of india ❤❤❤\n",
      "It's DARK AND BITTER, so if you're one of those sweet suger filled fake chocolate lovers, than this is out of your league, stick to your sugar candies.It's extremely hard to find anything this dark in India and even if there are, they're extremely pricy cause of low quantity production. Thanks to AMUL, now we have true dark chocolate at affordable price.NB: Loving the texture and feel of the chocolate. I'm really happy.Update: Finished 4 packs in less than 13 days. Ordered another 4. I just love the texture of the chocolate in my mouth. Truly in love ❤️\n",
      "It's literally heavenly feeling to taste this chocolate. The chocolate is bitter to the core. It has no added suger. Sugery chocolate/fake chocolate lovers won't like it. It's for those people who has developed taste for cocoa/cacao over the period of time. It's made for chocolate connoisseur. Price is very less when compare to other brands in market. Plus Amul is well-known brand itself. Packaging was nice.\n",
      "I simply love this pure cocoa taste....not sure if people consider this bitter, I personally do not feel so, may be very mildly. But the cocoa taste, flavor indeed feels great.I had earlier tasted upto 90% dark among the Amul chocolates (& of course couple of other makes including Lindt). In fact I have graduated in darkness with Amul's progression in a way starting at 55% then 75, 90 and now 99% - in fact love the whole range by Amul. As long as this range is available I will never have to look beyond for Dark chocolates. Thanks Amul. In fact on an earlier occasion I had purchased 99% dark of some other make and did not like the flavor at all - strangely it had kind of a sourish smell and so far a bit hesitant with this item as well at first.Another thing the chocolates were delivered superbly packaged - thanks to the seller. Had a carton box outside and inside of it the chocolate packs had a layer of some kind of gel filled plastic bags to keep the chocolates at non melting temperature....pretty cool - so no melting problem or anything for me.So this would be my daily dose of dark chocolate from now on like a cube (or sometimes two) after each meal - enjoyable in taste, and so sugar, no guilt!!\n",
      "So basically, this is not the chocolate for everyone. At first when I tasted it, I badly regretted buying it. It tasted nowhere near the chocolate you would find in the market. There isn't even the slightest hint of any kind of sweetness in it and most people would find it gross. But the more I ate it, the more I could feel it's richness and realised how decadent it is. It's not a chocolate, it's THE chocolate.\n",
      "Amul 99% cacao is the best dark/bitter chocolate available in India... excellent innovation by Amul. I may tell that I am not endorsing Amul or any other brand...just my own opinions. It has been proven that cacao is one of the healthiest superfoods on earth with amazing health benefits. It's full of antioxidants & flavonoids which increase lifespan. It's one of the highest sources of nitric oxide which dilates/widens & relaxes blood vessels of the body by reducing blockages, thereby supporting heart & brain health. Cacao is also anti inflammatory and anti carcinogenic, thus reduces cancer risk. Moreover, cacao is a natural blood thinner, so can prevent blood clots, reduce blood cholesterol & blood sugar and lower blood pressure. Overall Amul dark cacao chocolate has enormous health benefits...so we must be thankful to Amul for making such an awesome health food. Please ignore the negative and one star rated reviews as those people are ignorant and lack awareness. Requesting all the sugar lovers...please don't defame such a nice and healthy product by giving negative ratings and one star. I pity those innocent sweet toothed people which focus on tongue taste rather than general health. Again, I am not promoting Amul company or a representative of the same, these are my personal views & experience. Those who want to enhance quality of life and reduce onset of lifestyle/genetic diseases like cancer, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart attacks, cardiac arrest, etc must not think twice...just purchase the stuff & enjoy. Infact, Amul 99% Cacao Chocolate is a heavenly bliss with irresistible taste. It is indeed Delightful & Ambrosial. I am giving a five star rating to this authentic product...if there were 10 stars, I would have given full 10/10. Lastly, thanks to Amul & Amazon, too for providing such a nice superfood at my doorstep.\n",
      "It's dark, bitter but that's what the product is all about. Though it took almost 1 week for delivery, the chocolate didn't melt luckily. Good packaging by the seller.I fell the chocolate is not made with the finest of cocoa seeds. But I like it.\n",

      "Just got this butter. I read nutritional information on the package and found that the amount of TRANS FAT does not match the description! The description indicates 0%, but actually 3%. For such a famous brand as Patanjali shamefully deceiving. I require update the nutritional information in product description!\n",
      "Hi All,As I cut opened the pack I was really amazed by the ghee quality. We usually assume patanjali products to be  low/poor quality since it is manufactured indigenously or may be because we are already habitual of using Costly products. You may find the price hike too much of this Ghee, I can assure you it is because the quality is really authentic. I do not have the images of the ghee now. Ghee is thick, pale white in color. And taste so Delicious. The aroma is so authentic.It has long shelf life. However, I have recently started making Full cream cow milk ghee at home.Will definitely recommend everyone to try this Ghee.\n",
      "No issue with quality of Ghee. But the 1 litre Ghee is supposed to be consumed in a span of 09 months and the product which you had sent, was made in Dec. 2017. Already 07 months have passed. It means we will have to consume this 1 litre of Ghee in a span of two months. We were expecting fresh packet.  Disappointed with the seller.\n",
      "This product is worst...They are using duplicate ghee in this parcel...They mixed many other things in ghee...I threw it outside...Hate this\n",
      "First time i tried a patanjali product.. Its just waste of our hard earning money.. There is  nothing to say positively.. Its not a ghee.It dosent smell like ghee either taste.. Just like vanaspathi/cheap oil.. Dont try to buy this patanjali ghee.. Else ready to write a frusturated review like this😬\n",
      "Very bad. No smell at all.wasted my money.\n",
      "Never buy this.. giving duplicate product..its not original ghee rather mixture of oil and vanaspati..no aroma on cooking..taste too bad...and smells on heating\n",
      "I ordered for patangali 2  1 leter pouches,,but 1 is correct weight and another is less waight\n",
      "I am not satisfied with the quality of Ghee. It doesn't have any smell and it's very iight.  Mother Dairy ghee is far better than this. Overall it's a 50-50 purchase .\n",
      "Patanjali made cow milk deshi ghee is best of availed among all similar type of fmcg product, it taste was not so good but fair colour was same as normal home made deshi ghee have it also have a qr code which varifies that it is a original prodct made by patanjali so,finally I like to give a rating feedback to this deshi ghee product which is 08/10 it means 08 out of 10.\n",
      "Just got this butter. I read nutritional information on the package and found that the amount of TRANS FAT does not match the description! The description indicates 0%, but actually 3%. For such a famous brand as Patanjali shamefully deceiving. I require update the nutritional information in product description!\n",
      "Hi All,As I cut opened the pack I was really amazed by the ghee quality. We usually assume patanjali products to be  low/poor quality since it is manufactured indigenously or may be because we are already habitual of using Costly products. You may find the price hike too much of this Ghee, I can assure you it is because the quality is really authentic. I do not have the images of the ghee now. Ghee is thick, pale white in color.

The cap is quite sharp to open and close. This can hurt if not operated carefully. Secondly, its a tube. You usually, habitually, keep the tube inverted with cap down to take out the gel. When you open with cap down, the hard cap and not so thick gel work in conjunction and it opens with a jerk, throwing some of gel around, wasting as well as messing things around at times. I now, open the cap with cap on top and then invert the tube to take it out. I learnt after some messes.

      "More of an air freshener and smells good\n",
      "I have two small kids at home and they are continuously falling ill these days. So, I bought Dettol disinfected spray last week and very much satisfied with it. It has a very nice and mild scented fragrance. I tried it inside my car, washroom and kids room as well. It leaves the place very fresh and nice.Although, there is no way to check whether it kills the germs or not but still I think it worth to try once. All the freshners, which I had tried before, came with very hard scented and irritating smell. But this is very mild and soothing.One should give it a try for sure as it is pocket friendly too.\n",
      "Was looking for a good disinfectant spray as I have toddlers and keeping them safe from flu and virus is really tough.

      "Dettol Surface Disinfectant Spray is good  for killing germs. But few points are worth noting.1.

      "I have two small kids at home and they are continuously falling ill these days. So, I bought Dettol disinfected spray last week and very much satisfied with it. It has a very nice and mild scented fragrance. I tried it inside my car, washroom and kids room as well. It leaves the place very fresh and nice.Although, there is no way to check whether it kills the germs or not but still I think it worth to try once. All the freshners, which I had tried before, came with very hard scented and irritating smell. But this is very mild and soothing.One should give it a try for sure as it is pocket friendly too.\n",

Anyways, this one has a strong menthol smell and a highly effective disinfectant so fantastic for household use. Also works for laundry, but use it as a pre-wash, with a full wash cycle afterwards to clean out any residues.Also, a word of caution with this and any other disinfectants - please use it wisely and not indiscriminately as overuse not only can damage the environment but kill of beneficial microorganisms and cause harmful ones to develop resistance.\n",

Mind you, this is not the good old detail antiseptic liquid which comes with the clear bottle and green cap,which  is handy for cuts and wounds. This is an disinfectant liquid used for household cleaning. I use this in the washing machine along with the normal liquid detergent and let me tell you,my clothes smell amazing after wash.

      "What a gem from an old and trusted Indian brand. And such great value for money.The fragrance is nice powdery scent which is refreshing without being overpowering. The soap’s cleansing is good, not great. But it has a nice creaminess which is far beyond its modest price. In fact, it has a nice natural creaminess, and not the slipperiness of a Dove. Also, it seems to long last. A clear winner and will be a regular feature on my bathing rack.\n",
      "I liked the quality of the soap as it wasn't getting too chunky even if it stays wet for most part of the day. BUT, the DEO fragrance in body after taking bath with this soap *** All those are just marketing GIMMICKS. It's got no great fragrance than other soaps and actually it's just too minimal. Anyhow the product feels like of good quality.\n",
      "I really had liked the packing of this soap. But more than that, I remember as soon as I had unpacked it, the surprising fresh smell coming from it was amazing.The soap foam feels soft, rich and white. It moisturizes the skin perfectly. I have an oily skin so I wanted a soap which can balance the skin moisture, not over moisturizing not drying out the skin. And this soap pretty much does that.Also, it lasts for a good time, also most soaps give up their foaming capability as soon as they become small, but this one still gives great lather. Would recommend to everyone.\n",
      "Nice smelling scented bath soap from Cinthol. The scent lingers for a while even after washing off and leaves the bathroom also smelling great. Besides that it does its job of cleaning as it should. So full points there. Only thing is I was somewhat misguided and ordered a smaller pack when I needed a larger one.\n",
      "Nice quality product. Great product. Buying all the product from Amazon Pantry regularly.Thank you Amazon for such great quality products at such an affordable rate.\n",
      "I thought the product might be black or charcoal colour but it's a regular white one. The scent is not that great and didn't feel any difference btw normal average soap and this one. I feel the lime one is better than this. Its just a good marketing and nothing else.\n",
      "I placed order 4+1 soaps.But I have received without seal pack with 4 No's soaps only. Now how can get remaining soap.\n",
      "The soap is ok for bathing, no scent at all, more drier. The green one from cinthol is much better.\n",
      "For a long time I was searching for Indian soap equal to USA Ivory soap or the soap you get in Holiday Inn Hotels. Here it is!!!! Thank you Cinthol!\n",

      "After blindly using this soap for *years* it suddenly struck me that there is zero cooling effect in this soap now and by now I mean 2-3 years.I started using cinthol cool 6-7 years ago as a kid when I used to think how awesome is this soap (with that tingling cooling after sensation) I felt that this soap is way underrated because of that and the signature smell of it. But now I have realised that the cooling part is ZERO. And the fragrance is bland and doesn't last long.Either this soap is fake because I've been continuously ordering this soap online in saver pack of 4/5 soaps from Amazon (but the seller being a trusty one at that 🤔) or Godrej has changed the chemical composition of this soap.Either Godrej should bring a \"stronger\" version of cinthol cool soap or I should look for better alternatives because this soap isn't what it used to be once.\n",
      "I bought this product because I was experiencing some bad prickly heat and thought the menthol would help. Although I don't feel the 'minty' feeling I was hoping for, I am still well pleased. The scent is very nice and refreshing but not over-bearing like it should only be used by MALES, not medicinal smelling. I don't feel as though my skin is dry and cracking off. And the prickly heat symptoms are gone. I like this product, I will be suggesting it to my friends and family.\n",

      "This is not the same product as advertised. I received a Steax Vitariche gloss serum instead of Streax pro Vitagloss as the product name suggests. Called CS to get the refund and since i had closed my bank account since the order was placed i wanted the refund to come through amazon pay. However Amazon rep Aniket and the supervisor Krishna were absolutely unhelpful and went against common sense to keep telling me that the refund will only be processed to the closed bank account and the bank will issue me a DD. When i called them out on their lack of common sense they kept repeating themselves. Finally decided to give away the product than to deal with Amazon for a refund. This shows how base Amazon’s customer service is and a good sign for all to avoid using Amazon if you value your money and time.\n",
      "No doubt, product is awesome and available at very reasonable price in comparison to other serums and even better than those.But Amazon or Streax, can you tell me how to extract it without it's upper cap??Obviously, It may be a fault either by Manufacturing Company or Amazon while packaging.But overall, I am not finding a solution that how to popup serum out of the bottle?\n",

Though the texture is quite thin compared to a lot of other hair serums, but I like how it does not feel heavy on my hair and just a pump of it is enough to dab on my medium length hair. This does the basic job of a hair serum from detangling to providing moisture to the ends of the hair and since it goes a long way, so thumbs up from my side. And to my surprise, the new variant - vitariche gloss is way better than the previous one and this comes with nutty fragrance, which I totally love!\n",

Make hair soft and silky and last more than 2 days.The way I discovered this was I had applied this after bath to get ready for a function, it gives a finishing shine to my hairs.

      "Someone like me had always fancied upon getting some of my hair getting coloured when I see some people with colored or highlighted hair.Going to parlor or salon has always been hard on budget if you are living in a working middle class family.Finally I decided to get 2 packets of this hair highlighter after doing some research and surfing various Youtube videos.Coming to this product let me review as under:Pros:1  Gives good color/highlights if kept for about 45 minutes. (note: 30 minutes is not enough if you have dark black hair).2 The color stays for about 8-9 months and lightens with time.3 After about 1-1.5 months of applying this hair color, I would suggest to use henna/mehendi for about 1 hour in all you hairs...which will not only nourish your hair, but also give very good result for highlighted hairs.4 Personal tip- If you are not satisfied with colored/highlighted hair and want to remove it, use anti-dandruff shampoo 3-4 times while washing your hair. Also the Godrej hair dye (black) available in powder sachet is also effective in removing the highlights.Cons:1 One sachet is not enough even for short hair. Purchase 2 sachets if you want proper results. (note: if you are a girl with shoulder length hair or more, I would suggest 3 sachets).2 Does not give too much highlighted effect if you want to get noticed from others with normal hair.3 Just like any other chemical hair color, it damages you hair and makes your hair rough.Verdict:It is ok to give this a try once if you want to color/highlight your hair at home. I would rather suggest spending few bucks and get your hair highlighted in parlor or salon for better results.If you find my review helpful, please click the YES/HELPFUL button! 👍\n",

(note: if you are a girl with shoulder length hair or more, I would suggest 3 sachets).2 Does not give too much highlighted effect if you want to get noticed from others with normal hair.3 Just like any other chemical hair color, it damages you hair and makes your hair rough.Verdict:It is ok to give this a try once if you want to color/highlight your hair at home. I would rather suggest spending few bucks and get your hair highlighted in parlor or salon for better results.If you find my review helpful, please click the YES/HELPFUL button! 👍\n",
      "Best hair highlighter!  Loved it. Perfect for brown hair girls!  It stays for a long time. No damage, no dullness or frizzy hair.. The conditioner provided by streax is just awesome.. Makes your hair colour look more glossy and shiny. Smoothed out the hair..\n",

      "You don’t need to pay extra in salons when u have this. I just love this colour. But if you have long hair then you need two packets of this as such the quantity is less. Other than you can see everything in the picture. I just love the way it turned out.\n",

      "This color is not for highlighting natural hair. It can highlight only bleached hair. And this kit does not contain blond powder to bleach the hair. It contains only developer and color. I applied it and it didn't give me any visible result on my natural hair, although it can be seen in sunlight. But I didn't get the color I desired.\n",

      "Its a nightmare!!!!!!Trust me, I stuck to each and every direction written on the leaflet, and after almost 2 hours of blonder-shampoo-color-shampoo routine, my entire hair turned orange!!!! That too, not a funky orange. Just the badly-done-henna orange, if you know what I mean.I have tried blue and green and blonde hair color previously, semi+permanent and permanent, but never did I think that a safe color like cappucino brown will turn out to be such a disaster!!!!!!!!Had to order another color just to cover this mess up.

      "Overall Streax Ultralights Hair Color in Style 2 is an extremely affordable and easy to use at home, complete hair highlighting kit. On colored hair it adds a vibrant shade ranging from light brown to golden without causing any hair damage.\n",
      "Someone like me had always fancied upon getting some of my hair getting coloured when I see some people with colored or highlighted hair.Going to parlor or salon has always been hard on budget if you are living in a working middle class family.Finally I decided to get 2 packets of this hair highlighter after doing some research and surfing various Youtube videos.Coming to this product let me review as under:Pros:1  Gives good color/highlights if kept for about 45 minutes. (note: 30 minutes is not enough if you have dark black hair).2 The color stays for about 8-9 months and lightens with time.3 After about 1-1.5 months of applying this hair color, I would suggest to use henna/mehendi for about 1 hour in all you hairs...which will not only nourish your hair, but also give very good result for highlighted hairs.4 Personal tip- If you are not satisfied with colored/highlighted hair and want to remove it, use anti-dandruff shampoo 3-4 times while washing your hair. Also the Godrej hair dye (black) available in powder sachet is also effective in removing the highlights.Cons:1 One sachet is not enough even for short hair. Purchase 2 sachets if you want proper results. (note: if you are a girl with shoulder length hair or more, I would suggest 3 sachets).2 Does not give too much highlighted effect if you want to get noticed from others with normal hair.3 Just like any other chemical hair color, it damages you hair and makes your hair rough.Verdict:It is ok to give this a try once if you want to color/highlight your hair at home.

      "The blue came out great! I have dark brown hair and bleached it twice (with volume 30 developer) before applying the colour. Left the colour on for 45-60 minutes. My hair (which felt very rough after bleaching) became much softer after rinsing off the colour. I also used the Crazy Violet (can see it in the pic). Have previously used Manic Panic hair colour which is 4 times the price, and a lot less effective. Would definitely recommend this range from Streax :D\n",

Try to increase the time between washes as you can noticeably see it fade after every wash. Give your hair a blast of cold water after showering to lock the cuticle or the colour will bleed over your neck, clothes, everywhere until it dries.\n",

      "I loved this face wash, nice clean feel  post the use. I mostly used high end face products coz I have dry skin and what we usually get in the market is for oily skin but this is my new fav.  Well done Himalaya 👍🏼\n",
      "A very good product for winters for extremely dry skin,smells gud,leaves your skin soft and supple n pea size product is enough and to be used on wet face gives a little lather,,,,,a very good facewash for this price,,,have been using from one month now.\n",
      "It contains ammonia guyz. It's very dangerous. I bought it and used it one day one the next day morning my face swelled. But my skin is smooth and its glowing but I had numerous side effects. They will sell their products but people health could completely damaged\n",
      "Why free article not delivered/provided along product where it is clearly mentioned on bottle that  free body lotion 100ml and not for individual sale?\n",
      "Product is just awesome..  If u have dry skin,  then this is the right one for u...  Mine is damn dry skin and it is working just awesome unlike other face wash..  Even Himalaya neem face is not that good like aloevera one...\n",
      "This is superb! I love it from the day I started using it. It works like a charm. My skin is as soft as that of a new born baby and I receive loads of compliments day in and day out for this. Thank You so much, Himalaya Herbals. A big thanks to Amazon for the lovely packing and packaging of the product as well as timely delivery. If you found my review helpful, please click on helpful and let me know. Divine Thanks. BLESSED BE!!\n",
      "I regularly buy products from Amazon.in, but this was for the 1st time I had to face disappointment. Upon opening the package I found that the Himalaya  moisturizing Aloe Vera face wash was missing by half.😱\n",
      "Bought this product and delivered yesterday (6th Aug). Delivery and Packaging is superb as always.Regarding face wash: Suitable for dry face only. Therefore not recommended for other skin types. Kind of sticky and thus does not gives clean look.\n",
      "Initially I thought this face wash is waste of money as it doesn't lather at all but used it for a month anyways. I have started noticing a lot of difference in my skin. This made my skin very soft n all the dry patches I had on my face have reduced as this doesn't dry your skin rather hydrate your skin along with cleaning it... Best face wash for people with sensitive n dry skin.\n",
      "First impression : lathers very poorly. It's like applying lotion and washing it off. But well lack of foam doesn't necessarily mean it's not cleaning my skin.Second impression after washing : mmm skin does feel better,will try using it againFinal impression after using it some more : Very good 👍. It really does moisturize your skin. Perfect for dry skin, specially in harsh winter.I've very dry and sensitive skin so i need a very good moisturising  skin care routine specially in winter months.

So I ordered a 400ml pack at Amazon @Rs.168.The one I bought at local store is very thick,with almost gel like consistency, doesn't even spill out even if the cap is open and lying down,have to really squeeze it out.

      "Great shampoo! Sulfate free, mild, soothing fragrance. Make sure you take a lot more than you usually do for it to feel sufficient. Also, rub your palms together to create a soft lather and then rub on to scalp/hair. This is important. Really useful to those with curly hair. Gentle enough for your little one.\n",

      "Very Nice Product . It is very light weighted and quickly gets absorbed so that you don't feel  creamy when you get out using this. It gives a smooth feeling to our skin and will not irritated your skin at all. This product is a lotion and not a moisturizer so it is not a replaced for that this is baby lotion too. It works very well for your skin.As this is not an oily lotion which will not make you sweat even in hot summer It  smells  good and leaves skin smooth afterwards.  Even though this is a baby lotion people with very sensitive skin can also use this one as it is good for damaged skin too. After using for many months i can say it rebuilds your skin.Himalaya is now not using Paraben for Baby lotion so the lotion is safe than before. This lotion is not greesy at all. Please go for Original product as duplicates are out there.\n",

      "I've ordered it 3 times and likely to order again. Unlike the 400ml Himalaya gentle baby shampoo or gentle baby bath which has no seals, this lotion comes in clear laminated sealed pack and I've received it in good condition and packing all the 3 times I ordered. Although it's tad light it's okay for baby skin. I love it's fragrance, leaves my baby smelling nice and I use it myself too but it's too light for my dry skin,but of course it's meant mainly for babies.One winning feature about this particular 400ml pack is it's pump feature,makes it lot easier to literally use it singlehandedly which comes in real handy if you've to hold a squirming wriggling baby with your other hand!Update : I've ordered my 9th bottle! Initially seller give one bottle but nowadays the minimum quantity is 2 bottles.

      "I've ordered it 3 times and likely to order again. Unlike the 400ml Himalaya gentle baby shampoo or gentle baby bath which has no seals, this lotion comes in clear laminated sealed pack and I've received it in good condition and packing all the 3 times I ordered. Although it's tad light it's okay for baby skin. I love it's fragrance, leaves my baby smelling nice and I use it myself too but it's too light for my dry skin,but of course it's meant mainly for babies.One winning feature about this particular 400ml pack is it's pump feature,makes it lot easier to literally use it singlehandedly which comes in real handy if you've to hold a squirming wriggling baby with your other hand!Update : I've ordered my 9th bottle! Initially seller give one bottle but nowadays the minimum quantity is 2 bottles. But it's okay,your baby is going to use it every day and they come with very good shelf life so you finish them long before it's expiry date.\n",

      "Very Nice Product . It is very light weighted and quickly gets absorbed so that you don't feel  creamy when you get out using this.

      "I was using Himalaya moisturized 8 years back and my skin was really good, soft and gentle. After I moved to Hyderabad I moved to different products like Olay, Ponds, Lotus, Maybelline, Lakme etc. I wasn't happy with any of them. but this Anti aging cream is awesome, in a weeks time I can see and feel the difference in my skin, its very light and light smell. Totally like this cream.\n",
      "I have ordered this product for my Mom. And she is very happy with the results after using this product.It does works nicely to reduce your wrinkles if you will apply it on daily bases.At least use this twice in a day, if you really want to improve your skin tone.What I liked the most about this product:#####################################👌Its fragrance is good.👌Made up with natural ingredients, So it won't harm to your skin.👌Comes with a very cheaper price if we will  compare to other related brands.👌JUST go for this product if you are suffering from wrinkle problem.####################################GO for it.Its a value for money product under budget.🤗\n",
      "I got this for my mom because of the reviews and, to be honest, because of its low price. My mom has been applying it with great dedication every night for over 2 months now (had it ordered 2 times). I can’t say I have seen much of a difference. The least a cream can do is moisturize, but this cream doesn’t work as a moisturizer either. Again, I might be wrong and because my mom has just started using aging creams while she should have started at least some 10 years ago. But, I would really recommend going with better options. And people in the same predicament as mine, can you please suggest me creams that might work?\n",
      "So nice product, my skin is combination type (oily n dry), it works magically especially in winter. Gives u Extra softness..\n",
      "My mom changed from ponds day n night cream  after ages and the result is so good.\n",
      "I was bit skeptical about this cream as I was not sure this is good for my age group or not. After using this for about a week I can say that this one is great cream for anyone who is 25+. It's very moisturising so if you have oily skin like I do, little is more. I love to mix it with few drops of rose water n massage my face for a min or so.\n",
      "I would like to give five stars. Really amazing work on wrinkles. I am using my third bottle. But apply it on wrinkles before going to sleep. Apply little thicker. You can see the amazing results. Those who are worried about their wrinkles go for it. I got it for 165rs.\n",
      "This product gives burning sensation, forget removal of wrinkles and ageing signs. I even got red pathes and rashes on face after 3 days of use. M a huge Himalaya fan, but this product is a big NO!!\n",
      "I love it! Light texture, light scent, excellent results. Keeps you looking youthful, of course won't do miracles, but will slow aging process and I feel it removed expression lines that were starting to show. I've been using it for quite a while, almost a year, and it's the best product I've tried of its kind. I can use makeup straight on top of it and it's fine.\n",

      "I'm a milk-tea addicted person. Although, I control it upto thrice day but sometimes it may exceed 5.Since I like milk-tea alot, I have tried many Dust-teas available in the market.I've tried and tasted Wagh-bakri, brookebond, Taj, society, maharsthra chai, maa-beti Chai & you name it.I liked the society tea alot. This tea when boiled in the water gives a nice flavor and the color which no other teas can give.The packaging was nice. I ordered for a 1kg pack directly since I already knew about the taste.From the value for money standpoint, it is a little costlier (20-30 Rs per kg)  in comparison to its other teas of its class. But you will find it worth it. Just make sure you use a correct method to prepare to get the best out of it.Method in the sense, first boil it in water and then add milk.Directly adding into milk will also give you the good taste but the colour will fade away in that case.\n",
      "Received this product in damaged condition and it doesn’t come under returnable category. Since the seal is broken can’t use the product\n",
      "We are A family of tea drinkers and found it to be the best ever had.Been faithful to Tata tea gold since it got launched but had to buy society tea when our brand was not available during lockdown and found it to be better than Tata tea gold.Where Tata tea gold has longer leaf this one looks like any other tea but once the tea is brewed the colour and taste was as strong as Tata tea gold. Not a percent less.Price was also similar to Tata tea gold. Henceforth we are going to buy whichever brand is on discount online.\n",
      "Tea above rs. 400 per kg should not contain dust..At the rate 400/-, why to add dust with ctc granules.. Its a 100% margin business, still the company providing sub standard ctc instead of bopsm.. I will not going yo buy it again\n",
      "Society tea by far is the best brand in terms of taste, colour and flavour. I'm using this brand of tea since ages, maybe more than 15 years. Infact I dont buy any other tea except Society. But this time Im not satisfied with my buy as no discounts were offered.\n",
      "Product is fine. Package had a hole in it & tea powder leaked out.\n",
      "Society Masala Tea is far better than this one. Pack within expiry but due to storage conditions discolored.\n",
      "I am using this tea for last 7 year.  Getting this product in bangalore is not easy. Sometime it will be avaialble. Happy to get this product through Amazon.Tea flavour is too good.  After having Society tea, we are not fine in having any other tea :)To get the proper flavour, boil it in water well then add milk.  Sometime i use this tea decoction for hair conditioning also. So pure.\n",

      "I'm a milk-tea addicted person. Although, I control it upto thrice day but sometimes it may exceed 5.Since I like milk-tea alot, I have tried many Dust-teas available in the market.I've tried and tasted Wagh-bakri, brookebond, Taj, society, maharsthra chai, maa-beti Chai & you name it.I liked the society tea alot. This tea when boiled in the water gives a nice flavor and the color which no other teas can give.The packaging was nice. I ordered for a 1kg pack directly since I already knew about the taste.From the value for money standpoint, it is a little costlier (20-30 Rs per kg)  in comparison to its other teas of its class. But you will find it worth it. Just make sure you use a correct method to prepare to get the best out of it.Method in the sense, first boil it in water and then add milk.Directly adding into milk will also give you the good taste but the colour will fade away in that case.\n",
      "Received this product in damaged condition and it doesn’t come under returnable category. Since the seal is broken can’t use the product\n",
      "We are A family of tea drinkers and found it to be the best ever had.Been faithful to Tata tea gold since it got launched but had to buy society tea when our brand was not available during lockdown and found it to be better than Tata tea gold.Where Tata tea gold has longer leaf this one looks like any other tea but once the tea is brewed the colour and taste was as strong as Tata tea gold. Not a percent less.Price was also similar to Tata tea gold. Henceforth we are going to buy whichever brand is on discount online.\n",
      "Tea above rs. 400 per kg should not contain dust..At the rate 400/-, why to add dust with ctc granules.. Its a 100% margin business, still the company providing sub standard ctc instead of bopsm.. I will not going yo buy it again\n",
      "Society tea by far is the best brand in terms of taste, colour and flavour. I'm using this brand of tea since ages, maybe more than 15 years. Infact I dont buy any other tea except Society. But this time Im not satisfied with my buy as no discounts were offered.\n",
      "Product is fine. Package had a hole in it & tea powder leaked out.\n",
      "Society Masala Tea is far better than this one. Pack within expiry but due to storage conditions discolored.\n",
      "I am using this tea for last 7 year.  Getting this product in bangalore is not easy. Sometime it will be avaialble. Happy to get this product through Amazon.Tea flavour is too good.  After having Society tea, we are not fine in having any other tea :)To get the proper flavour, boil it in water well then add milk.  Sometime i use this tea decoction for hair conditioning also. So pure.\n",

      "Recently, I visited a relative in Dubai and tasted Society Masala tea for the 1st time.  I simply loved it, more so when I found real ingredients like cinnamon, cardamom, ginger etc. written on the box.  I ordered same tea in india once I got back and I am shocked to see that there are no real ingredients.  The box says there are added 'flovors' only.  How disgusting to find that what is sold in india and exported abroad is totally different.  I wish I could return the tea but unfortunately, Amazon does not accept return of food items.\n",
      "Excellent product as its smell,taste and flavour... Every customer who have idea about tea take it without dought ...drink with milk or without milk. Thank you my Amazon and thank you seller... I am very satisfied.\n",
      "Very good one. Tastes awesome. But the product has come in a plastic water bottle which is free. The plastic is very cheap and the smell of plastic is there in the tea also. Had to empty the contents to a better container. Earlier the container the tea came was very good. This time they have changed it to a water bottle.\n",
      "The tea is good. But old stock. Packed on October 2016. Best before 12 months of packing. So it's already outdated when received.\n",
      "The tea is great but the delivery charges ruins the whole taste and it feels iy aint orth it. 130 is MRP & 120 is Delivery charges which make it double the price, thus not worth it.\n",
      "This masla tea is best in taste and aroma.I purchased four  different  companies  masala tea to compare the taste .l found test of Society masala  over and above three companies  masala tea.Further a small quantity  of  tea leaves  require to prepare  aromic tasty tea.I am continuously  purchasing this tea now.\n",
      "When I made my first brew I got impressed by the smell only. The smell was really nice and above all masala was thoroughly mixed within the tea leaves which release it's taste and aroma when water boils. Delivery was fine and instead of box I got a very beautiful sipper which made my day.\n",
      "The which has been sent looks like it's a fake product as there are lumps in it ... plus there a foul smell coming out of it please take it back and refund my money\n",
      "Good but very spicy. Young people will like it but for old/children it is very strong.If mixed with normal tea then better.\n",
      "Good for the first time use. Later you get irritated due to the spices. May be they should have added more cardamom\n",

      "As the pricing was highest for this product in the company range assumed that it would be the best color and flavor.However was disspointed as the flavor is similar to the cheaper leaf tea or even some good dust variety. Also the tea leaves had some foul chemical odour coming, usually teas leaves give a fine frangance.This was prepared with full milk and not black. Not buying this again for sure.\n",
      "Great taste. Bought it for my parents as they prefer mild teas and it is great for both mild and strong teas. We add a bit more leaves to make it strong. Most teas in Kerala have a flowery taste and they are not good for masala chai. This purchase solved that issue. It's great as a black tea as well. Just don't boil it while making black tea. Boil the leaves only for masala chai.\n",

      "It is strong and tastes very good. After trying almost 10 different brands of tea, I have found the one I like. I have tried Taj Mahal, Red label, RCM and many different others.I like my tea strong and for that you don't have to add too much of this tea. It is not just too strong tea, it tastes good. Most in my family like it and this is the one we are going to use from now on along with Red Label for those who like Red Label more.And Amazon, from time to time, provides good discounts on products and makes them affordable for all. Btw, it sells for 355 next door mall when Amazon is selling it for 385. I know shipping costs, so it is ok.\n",
      "We in our family have switched from Red Label to Tata Tea Gold now.Red Label is not bad, its just this one is better.This tea is perfect blend of aroma, taste and strong nature of tea. This is perfectly balanced tea between taste and kadak chai.Wagh bakri Tea is too strong with awful taste and Red Label is not so strong but taste good.This one got balanced both of it. So a must buy.\n",

Because of the controversial advertising by Red Label where they said that people go to Kumbh Mela to abandon  their old age parents.

I got it at discounted price...I got the product at 15% discounted price, as I bought the product during Super Value Days.The manufacturing date of product was just 2 and half months ago from date when I received the product in hand. Hence it is recently manufactured product. Also the product have a very good shelf life.Amazon delivered the product in very good condition and packaging of the product was just awesome. No damage. Amazing...The Amazon pantry box are very hard and during packaging they insert air filled sealed packets, so that the items don't move and pressure is absorbed by the air filled packets.Delivery of my order was just the next day morning. The delivery man took the package inside of my house, as it was heavy and kept the pantry box over a table, as I told him.

With 2 spoons for a cup of tea there is no taste at all it feels like we are having just hot water with sugar. It needs 3 spoons for a cup, to atleast get slight taste of tea.

      "If you really a teas fan, you definitely not being unaware of the TATA Tea family. Trusted brand from so many years. I tried almost every standard brand of Teas available in the market, but at last I can say that TATA Tea is the best available brand in the printed price. Although TATA Tea brand is already quite efficient in serving the purpose but the current addition of 'TATA Tea Gold' actually makes sense because of the quality enhancement by adding dried whole tea leaves in to the processed tea. Mixing of whole leaf resulted into the enhanced flavor & color of the prepared Tea. Not more concentrated not milder, it’s like a balanced golden color with real taste/flavor which designed exactly keeping in mind the expectation of the user.1. I agree that if you require strong color/flavor you need to add a little more leaves in to the preparation because TATA Tea Gold is not meant for people who like very strong color seekers. Its more workable for people who wants real flavor with natural golden color in the final preparation. Although even a single tea-spoon is enough to prepare a natural golden cup full of real tea.2. One may keep in mind before using that this tea contains real whole dry tea leaves, so it may take more 2 minutes in preparation in comparison with other brands and the reason is, it is without any added artificial colors into it. The whole dried tea leaves takes time to release real flavor of the contents.3. Taste is premium & up to the expectations as always.4. Packaging is good enough. Visual ergonomic principles well taken into consideration designing the same. Its smarter and visually appealing than the previous packs.I’m using this product from more than 2 years. So, its not an random review. In my family we are using this product in making of every single cup day and night 24x7, whenver we feel like to have one.\n",
      "I prefer Tata tea to Brooke Bond/Taj Mahal.# Mild taste and fresh aroma# Gives me a soothing effect and relishes# Only small quantity sufficient for making tea# Does not play around with the basic tea taste# Can be consumed with milk or without itThe only issue is with the packaging, I would have preferred plastic box packaging for the price.That would actually help in preserving the aroma and prevent moisture.But, it's one of the best tea for everyday use.Cheers :)\n",
      "Flavour of this tea is goodIt includes little leafs you can see them in itMust try tea\n",
      "For those who love tea this is a great blend.1. It is a mix of  assam tea and leaf tea - gets you the best of both.2. To enjoy the blend and the tea it should be put in boiling water ( do not boil it post putting tea)3. Let it simmer for some time  3-5 min , and add sugar and milk separately .4.

The product is a genuine product...There are other variety of Tea available in the market but among those Tata gold tea is is the best tea according to me for daily use...I got the product at 15% discounted price, as I bought the product during Super Value Days.The manufacturing date of product was just 2 and half months ago from date when I received the product in hand. Hence it is recently manufactured product. Also the product have a very good shelf life.Amazon delivered the product in very good condition and packaging of the product was just awesome. No damage. Amazing...The Amazon pantry box are very hard and during packaging they insert air filled sealed packets, so that the items don't move and pressure is absorbed by the air filled packets.Delivery of my order was just the next day morning. The delivery man took the package inside of my house, as it was heavy and kept the pantry box over a table, as I told him. I behavior of the delivery man was good.I am highly satisfied with the product and I recommend you to buy the product without any fear and hesitation. Believe me you will be satisfied after receiving the product and using it.\n",
      "After using Taj Mahal tea for 20 years, now since the quality of Taj Mahal tea has gone down tremendously, and we have gas and stomach problems after consuming taj mahal tea, we wanted to shift for a better tea. After finding out a lot about different brands, I can assure you This is best tea in India. Always buy this.The taste is awesome, the only drawback is you have to put a lot of tea if you're used to drinking strong tea. Otherwise this is awesome.\n",
      "Once you see the packing and presentation of the package, one gets positive vibes and expects a lot more than regular tea. ALAS! It is much the same as Agni. Nothing more. Have to use good quantity to prepare good tea.\n",
      "I am using Tata tea Premium regulary, but bought Tata tea gold just to give it a try to see if it's more strong in flavour/aroma or tastes something different. However could not feel much difference rather it is more or less same like Premium tea infact Premium is better..\n",
      "I have been taking Tata Gold tea since over two decades now. I have tried many cheap and expensive products but Tata Gold is non-replaceable. The new golden color packing is attractive.\n",
      "This is best quality tea for daily use at cheap rate. Very fast,next day delivery by Amazon pantry.\n",
      "If you really a teas fan, you definitely not being unaware of the TATA Tea family. Trusted brand from so many years. I tried almost every standard brand of Teas available in the market, but at last I can say that TATA Tea is the best available brand in the printed price. Although TATA Tea brand is already quite efficient in serving the purpose but the current addition of 'TATA Tea Gold' actually makes sense because of the quality enhancement by adding dried whole tea leaves in to the processed tea. Mixing of whole leaf resulted into the enhanced flavor & color of the prepared Tea. Not more concentrated not milder, it’s like a balanced golden color with real taste/flavor which designed exactly keeping in mind the expectation of the user.1. I agree that if you require strong color/flavor you need to add a little more leaves in to the preparation because TATA Tea Gold is not meant for people who like very strong color seekers. Its more workable for people who wants real flavor with natural golden color in the final preparation. Although even a single tea-spoon is enough to prepare a natural golden cup full of real tea.2. One may keep in mind before using that this tea contains real whole dry tea leaves, so it may take more 2 minutes in preparation in comparison with other brands and the reason is, it is without any added artificial colors into it. The whole dried tea leaves takes time to release real flavor of the contents.3. Taste is premium & up to the expectations as always.4. Packaging is good enough. Visual ergonomic principles well taken into consideration designing the same. Its smarter and visually appealing than the previous packs.I’m using this product from more than 2 years. So, its not an random review. In my family we are using this product in making of every single cup day and night 24x7, whenver we feel like to have one.\n",
      "I prefer Tata tea to Brooke Bond/Taj Mahal.# Mild taste and fresh aroma# Gives me a soothing effect and relishes# Only small quantity sufficient for making tea# Does not play around with the basic tea taste# Can be consumed with milk or without itThe only issue is with the packaging, I would have preferred plastic box packaging for the price.That would actually help in preserving the aroma and prevent moisture.But, it's one of the best tea for everyday use.Cheers :)\n",
      "Flavour of this tea is goodIt includes little leafs you can see them in itMust try tea\n",
      "For those who love tea this is a great blend.1. It is a mix of  assam tea and leaf tea - gets you the best of both.2. To enjoy the blend and the tea it should be put in boiling water ( do not boil it post putting tea)3. Let it simmer for some time  3-5 min , and add sugar and milk separately .4. It works out great for the tea lovers and offers a consistent blend all the time.Once you start liking this tea - you will get hooked to it....\n",

It displays only call And Whatsapp’s texts notifications ( I have connected my band to iphone so I have no idea if it performs differently when connected to Android smartphones).

      "I have to thank the amazon recommendation engine for suggesting the mysore sandal talc. I never knew mysore sandal brand had a talc! I had purchased mysore sandal soap few weeks back and perhaps due to this purchase amazon would have recommended this as well. Glad I clicked the suggestion and bought one of these! It's good bye to my existing Ponds Sandalwood talc !This review compares Mysore sandal talc vis-a-vis Ponds Sandalwood talcPros-1. The Fragrance is the first thing which hits you as soon as you open the bottle. Its smells pure authentic sandal wood than the perfumed ponds talc powder2. The mysore sandal talc allows you to decide the size of the hole you want to have on the bottle. Ponds one forces you to have 3 holes as soon as you want the top cover. I always hated this with the ponds talc. Ponds really wants you to use more than what you need!3. The fragrance last longer than the ponds sandalwood talc even though out the day! Believe it or not - you have to try one and be the judge!4. Some reviews talk about the powder not been finely powdered. Nothing like that - the powder is as fine as it's with Ponds sandalwood talc. No more no less!5. The bottle is sealed with a hologram sticker - that's assurance of genuine product from mysore sandal!6. Somehow I like the press-fit top of the bottle to keep the fragrance intact in the bottle when not in use! Ponds bottle was a twist to close top which is not really a seal tight way of shutting close the bottle7. Last but not the least- mysore sandal talc is 50% cheaper than Ponds sandalwood - why on earth would I ever buy Ponds again?Cons-None that i spotted yet\n",
      "Mysore Sandal is best talc ever in market.. Long-lasting fragrance increase body charm. And I can its Pure natural sandalwood talc. also its very economic talc but no compromise in quality. Go on.....\n",
      "First time buy, the Talc is okay as its from Mysore Sandal, but still not sure about the scent, longevity and essence of it.Also minimum buy of 2, is not fair & also there wasn't any discount even at the sale time :-( ;-)Well, Amazon, Cloudtail India & Mysore Sandal have done good job, and I believe it will be genuine product!\n",
      "Just amazing fragrance....original product Delicately perfumed with pure natural sandalwood oil....thanks Amazon for giving me natural product ...Mysore sandal talc is the best talc forever..\n",
      "Texture is not good, should be finer. Not so cheap either, you can get Nivea 400 gms at same price.Quality also not good, not soft on my skin. Fragrance also not good, guess not a fan of sandalwood after all.\n",
      "be careful. the image is misleading. it looks like it is offering 3 diff sizes of talcum powder whereas the seller gives only one (large size). if you are expecting to receive all the 3 diff sizes of talcum powder then you are in for a big shock. I think the seller must take note and provide correct product image.\n",
      "I had ordered 2 of these which arrived on Dec 28 2019. However on opening the seals I noticed an unusual detergent like smell and had no smell like sandalwood oil.  It seems either a fraudulent product has been inserted into the container at the source or maybe this was done by some unethical third party. Wanted to return the items, but being a toiletry product, there is no such option. Very unhappy with the purchase\n",
      "It has terrific scent. It's not a pinkish or yellowish colour it's white colour but we can feel it long n last.I think package Design is changed but I'm sure about it, it's genuine product.Highly recommended go with this if ur choice is sandal.Because it's good brand with half of price than other ponds n santoor.\n",
      "Nice product, being a govt made product, the quality and genuineness are there.  No stains left in skin after use, whereas Ponds and some other sandal wood powders leave stucky white stain marks. Fragrance is also long lasting.\n",
      "The best product .. So pure.. Must buy\n",

      "Mysore Sandal is best talc ever in market.. Long-lasting fragrance increase body charm. And I can its Pure natural sandalwood talc. also its very economic talc but no compromise in quality. Go on.....\n",
      "First time buy, the Talc is okay as its from Mysore Sandal, but still not sure about the scent, longevity and essence of it.Also minimum buy of 2, is not fair & also there wasn't any discount even at the sale time :-( ;-)Well, Amazon, Cloudtail India & Mysore Sandal have done good job, and I believe it will be genuine product!\n",
      "Just amazing fragrance....original product Delicately perfumed with pure natural sandalwood oil....thanks Amazon for giving me natural product ...Mysore sandal talc is the best talc forever..\n",

      "be careful. the image is misleading. it looks like it is offering 3 diff sizes of talcum powder whereas the seller gives only one (large size). if you are expecting to receive all the 3 diff sizes of talcum powder then you are in for a big shock.

      "It has terrific scent. It's not a pinkish or yellowish colour it's white colour but we can feel it long n last.I think package Design is changed but I'm sure about it, it's genuine product.Highly recommended go with this if ur choice is sandal.Because it's good brand with half of price than other ponds n santoor.\n",

      "I have to thank the amazon recommendation engine for suggesting the mysore sandal talc. I never knew mysore sandal brand had a talc! I had purchased mysore sandal soap few weeks back and perhaps due to this purchase amazon would have recommended this as well. Glad I clicked the suggestion and bought one of these! It's good bye to my existing Ponds Sandalwood talc !This review compares Mysore sandal talc vis-a-vis Ponds Sandalwood talcPros-1. The Fragrance is the first thing which hits you as soon as you open the bottle. Its smells pure authentic sandal wood than the perfumed ponds talc powder2. The mysore sandal talc allows you to decide the size of the hole you want to have on the bottle. Ponds one forces you to have 3 holes as soon as you want the top cover. I always hated this with the ponds talc. Ponds really wants you to use more than what you need!3. The fragrance last longer than the ponds sandalwood talc even though out the day! Believe it or not - you have to try one and be the judge!4. Some reviews talk about the powder not been finely powdered. Nothing like that - the powder is as fine as it's with Ponds sandalwood talc. No more no less!5. The bottle is sealed with a hologram sticker - that's assurance of genuine product from mysore sandal!6. Somehow I like the press-fit top of the bottle to keep the fragrance intact in the bottle when not in use! Ponds bottle was a twist to close top which is not really a seal tight way of shutting close the bottle7.

      "I bought this on a lark and it had been sitting on a shelf for a very long time. Till I developed warts on my chin. No amount of pulling and scrubbing helped and I was reluctant to use over-the-counter wart paint because of all the pharma warnings on them.I decided to use this clay on the warts, covering them with a generous coat of the clay twice a day and kept it on day and night for a month. Voila!I had to be patient but a month of application fixed my skin. Whatever this face pack contains, it is extremely effective. I used to a feel a constant sting after application but it can be ignored. The best part is that it didn't affect healthy skin adversely unlike wart paints which require precautions.Caution - These warts weren't because of an STD. I probably picked them up at the gym or some other place with too many people milling around in sweat. Please seek your doctor's advice if you have an STD. This face pack should not be applied on your eyelids or where you have a chance of ingesting it. Read disclaimers on the package.\n",

Tried calling the customer care n they say, I will be charged Rs.500 for the technician visit. It is only 2 months I bought it. Very bad product.', \"To start off, the safe arrived with a Low Battery message, meaning that before I could do anything else, I had to go and get new batteries for this brand new item. Once you get things in order, the safe works well and serves its purpose, however, the manual provided is obsolete, and the instructions do not match up with this product. There are no solutions posted online either. If you want to program the safe, you have to figure it out on your own. The customer service personnel were not helpful either and they kept trying to force me to get a technician to come to my house at the cost of Rs. 500 just to program the device, which completely defeats the purpose of online shopping. Don't fall for it. This is rather ridiculous for such a big brand like Godrej.In case anyone else needs to re-program their home code, here is what I was able to do. I hope it works for you too:1.) The instructions indicate to press 68#, but it actually means 68(Lock). If the instructions indicate *, try pressing Clear2.) Every time I pressed 68#, I got an error message, so I had to go through all the steps listed below.3.) Before you can change personal code in home mode, you will need to Access The Programming (pg. 6). The code is 751019 which means that there are 6 different features that you can program. Go through all the steps and change the numbers as they suit you. When you get to the last digit, there are no instructions written in the book, so you will have to figure this out on your own. If the last digit is 1, change it to 0 or 9.4.) After going through the programming and changing the last number, you should be able to go back to change the personal code in home mode.5.) If you set your password and it doesn't lock, go back to the programming again, and change the last digit back to what it was originally.Good luck.\", 'Received damaged product. The case is scratched in multiple places and all the parts are loose. Looks like  a duplicate box with iron is painted and set up with godrej tag and sent to us. Highly dissatisfied with the product quality', \"The product was good. But starting it for the first time took me several hours to start and install it properly.Here I will list out all steps so that reading this other people might find it helpful.1. Unwrap the package properly. Look for any damages.2. You will find a set of keys attached in a plastic sachet.3. Use the key to open the locker. There is a white cover near the button panel ,open it to insert keys.4. Inside the locker you will find the manual and wall mounting knots.5. The other side of the keypad panel will contain the battery space which needs 4 AA batteries for the led to start. But before inserting the batteries do see the positive & negative marked side and insert the batteries according to the charge respectively.6. Close the battery lid and led will automatically start working. The battery lid needs a small screw to get fixed. so if u don't find the screw in any plastic packets then use another aftermarket screws or maybe the screw is present inside the locker mechanism.7. The locker mechanism screws can be unlocked by a particular opener which will be given with the mounting knots inside the locker.8. The locker is now ready to use. Remove the keys and use the led to unlock and lock it. The default password is 1234.9. Please donot apply any pressure or try to press the firm bolts of the locker mechanism when the locker is open. Let the motor of the locker do its work.10. If the locker shows any other error message. Do consult the user manual.Note. Please be calm and do things properly or else you might damage the product.\", 'Easy to operate.But installation is a head breaking thing.

Thanks to AMUL, now we have true dark chocolate at affordable price.NB: Loving the texture and feel of the chocolate. I'm really happy.Update: Finished 4 packs in less than 13 days. Ordered another 4. I just love the texture of the chocolate in my mouth. Truly in love ❤️\", \"It's literally heavenly feeling to taste this chocolate. The chocolate is bitter to the core. It has no added suger. Sugery chocolate/fake chocolate lovers won't like it. It's for those people who has developed taste for cocoa/cacao over the period of time. It's made for chocolate connoisseur. Price is very less when compare to other brands in market. Plus Amul is well-known brand itself. Packaging was nice.\", \"I simply love this pure cocoa taste....not sure if people consider this bitter, I personally do not feel so, may be very mildly. But the cocoa taste, flavor indeed feels great.I had earlier tasted upto 90% dark among the Amul chocolates (& of course couple of other makes including Lindt). In fact I have graduated in darkness with Amul's progression in a way starting at 55% then 75, 90 and now 99% - in fact love the whole range by Amul. As long as this range is available I will never have to look beyond for Dark chocolates. Thanks Amul. In fact on an earlier occasion I had purchased 99% dark of some other make and did not like the flavor at all - strangely it had kind of a sourish smell and so far a bit hesitant with this item as well at first.Another thing the chocolates were delivered superbly packaged - thanks to the seller. Had a carton box outside and inside of it the chocolate packs had a layer of some kind of gel filled plastic bags to keep the chocolates at non melting temperature....pretty cool - so no melting problem or anything for me.So this would be my daily dose of dark chocolate from now on like a cube (or sometimes two) after each meal - enjoyable in taste, and so sugar, no guilt!!\", \"So basically, this is not the chocolate for everyone. At first when I tasted it, I badly regretted buying it. It tasted nowhere near the chocolate you would find in the market. There isn't even the slightest hint of any kind of sweetness in it and most people would find it gross. But the more I ate it, the more I could feel it's richness and realised how decadent it is. It's not a chocolate, it's THE chocolate.\", \"Amul 99% cacao is the best dark/bitter chocolate available in India... excellent innovation by Amul. I may tell that I am not endorsing Amul or any other brand...just my own opinions. It has been proven that cacao is one of the healthiest superfoods on earth with amazing health benefits. It's full of antioxidants & flavonoids which increase lifespan. It's one of the highest sources of nitric oxide which dilates/widens & relaxes blood vessels of the body by reducing blockages, thereby supporting heart & brain health. Cacao is also anti inflammatory and anti carcinogenic, thus reduces cancer risk. Moreover, cacao is a natural blood thinner, so can prevent blood clots, reduce blood cholesterol & blood sugar and lower blood pressure. Overall Amul dark cacao chocolate has enormous health benefits...so we must be thankful to Amul for making such an awesome health food. Please ignore the negative and one star rated reviews as those people are ignorant and lack awareness. Requesting all the sugar lovers...please don't defame such a nice and healthy product by giving negative ratings and one star. I pity those innocent sweet toothed people which focus on tongue taste rather than general health. Again, I am not promoting Amul company or a representative of the same, these are my personal views & experience. Those who want to enhance quality of life and reduce onset of lifestyle/genetic diseases like cancer, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart attacks, cardiac arrest, etc must not think twice...just purchase the stuff & enjoy. Infact, Amul 99% Cacao Chocolate is a heavenly bliss with irresistible taste. It is indeed Delightful & Ambrosial. I am giving a five star rating to this authentic product...if there were 10 stars, I would have given full 10/10. Lastly, thanks to Amul & Amazon, too for providing such a nice superfood at my doorstep.\", \"It's dark, bitter but that's what the product is all about.

Just chop this chocolate into small pieces and stir it in your milk!\", \"Bitter is a very silple word, need some terrible word to describe this, i don't think i can go beyond 70% cocao... now i don't know what i will do with two bars.... on a lighter note: guys think twice before ordering, this is some 3rd degree torture not for general public use, might help military to torture terrorists. If i was a terrorist i would speak out everything after eating this in return of sugar..Jokes apart guys this is best and cheapest you can get, well done,  amul really the taste of india ❤❤❤\", \"It's DARK AND BITTER, so if you're one of those sweet suger filled fake chocolate lovers, than this is out of your league, stick to your sugar candies.It's extremely hard to find anything this dark in India and even if there are, they're extremely pricy cause of low quantity production. Thanks to AMUL, now we have true dark chocolate at affordable price.NB: Loving the texture and feel of the chocolate. I'm really happy.Update: Finished 4 packs in less than 13 days. Ordered another 4. I just love the texture of the chocolate in my mouth. Truly in love ❤️\", \"It's literally heavenly feeling to taste this chocolate. The chocolate is bitter to the core. It has no added suger. Sugery chocolate/fake chocolate lovers won't like it. It's for those people who has developed taste for cocoa/cacao over the period of time. It's made for chocolate connoisseur. Price is very less when compare to other brands in market. Plus Amul is well-known brand itself. Packaging was nice.\", \"I simply love this pure cocoa taste....not sure if people consider this bitter, I personally do not feel so, may be very mildly. But the cocoa taste, flavor indeed feels great.I had earlier tasted upto 90% dark among the Amul chocolates (& of course couple of other makes including Lindt). In fact I have graduated in darkness with Amul's progression in a way starting at 55% then 75, 90 and now 99% - in fact love the whole range by Amul. As long as this range is available I will never have to look beyond for Dark chocolates. Thanks Amul. In fact on an earlier occasion I had purchased 99% dark of some other make and did not like the flavor at all - strangely it had kind of a sourish smell and so far a bit hesitant with this item as well at first.Another thing the chocolates were delivered superbly packaged - thanks to the seller. Had a carton box outside and inside of it the chocolate packs had a layer of some kind of gel filled plastic bags to keep the chocolates at non melting temperature....pretty cool - so no melting problem or anything for me.So this would be my daily dose of dark chocolate from now on like a cube (or sometimes two) after each meal - enjoyable in taste, and so sugar, no guilt!!\", \"So basically, this is not the chocolate for everyone. At first when I tasted it, I badly regretted buying it. It tasted nowhere near the chocolate you would find in the market. There isn't even the slightest hint of any kind of sweetness in it and most people would find it gross. But the more I ate it, the more I could feel it's richness and realised how decadent it is. It's not a chocolate, it's THE chocolate.\", \"Amul 99% cacao is the best dark/bitter chocolate available in India... excellent innovation by Amul. I may tell that I am not endorsing Amul or any other brand...just my own opinions. It has been proven that cacao is one of the healthiest superfoods on earth with amazing health benefits. It's full of antioxidants & flavonoids which increase lifespan. It's one of the highest sources of nitric oxide which dilates/widens & relaxes blood vessels of the body by reducing blockages, thereby supporting heart & brain health. Cacao is also anti inflammatory and anti carcinogenic, thus reduces cancer risk. Moreover, cacao is a natural blood thinner, so can prevent blood clots, reduce blood cholesterol & blood sugar and lower blood pressure. Overall Amul dark cacao chocolate has enormous health benefits...so we must be thankful to Amul for making such an awesome health food. Please ignore the negative and one star rated reviews as those people are ignorant and lack awareness. Requesting all the sugar lovers...please don't defame such a nice and healthy product by giving negative ratings and one star. I pity those innocent sweet toothed people which focus on tongue taste rather than general health. Again, I am not promoting Amul company or a representative of the same, these are my personal views & experience. Those who want to enhance quality of life and reduce onset of lifestyle/genetic diseases like cancer, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart attacks, cardiac arrest, etc must not think twice...just purchase the stuff & enjoy. Infact, Amul 99% Cacao Chocolate is a heavenly bliss with irresistible taste. It is indeed Delightful & Ambrosial. I am giving a five star rating to this authentic product...if there were 10 stars, I would have given full 10/10. Lastly, thanks to Amul & Amazon, too for providing such a nice superfood at my doorstep.\", \"It's dark, bitter but that's what the product is all about. Though it took almost 1 week for delivery, the chocolate didn't melt luckily. Good packaging by the seller.I fell the chocolate is not made with the finest of cocoa seeds.

Also works for laundry, but use it as a pre-wash, with a full wash cycle afterwards to clean out any residues.Also, a word of caution with this and any other disinfectants - please use it wisely and not indiscriminately as overuse not only can damage the environment but kill of beneficial microorganisms and cause harmful ones to develop resistance.', \"This is one of the best disinfectant I have ever used.

Active ingredients are  quaternary ammonium chloride compounds which are a very potent and effective disinfectant - you can find these in most non-bleach disinfectant solutions. This is not the same as Dettol antiseptic used for skin so do not use it for that purpose. I am glad that Dettol introduced this as it was difficult to find purpose-made disinfectant concentrates of this formulation - the alternative was Amway Pursue which is not only much more expensive but would involve the hassle of dealing with a pushy Amway salesperson. Anyways, this one has a strong menthol smell and a highly effective disinfectant so fantastic for household use. Also works for laundry, but use it as a pre-wash, with a full wash cycle afterwards to clean out any residues.Also, a word of caution with this and any other disinfectants - please use it wisely and not indiscriminately as overuse not only can damage the environment but kill of beneficial microorganisms and cause harmful ones to develop resistance.', \"This is one of the best disinfectant I have ever used.

And the fragrance is bland and doesn\\'t last long.Either this soap is fake because I\\'ve been continuously ordering this soap online in saver pack of 4/5 soaps from Amazon (but the seller being a trusty one at that 🤔) or Godrej has changed the chemical composition of this soap.Either Godrej should bring a \"stronger\" version of cinthol cool soap or I should look for better alternatives because this soap isn\\'t what it used to be once.', \"I bought this product because I was experiencing some bad prickly heat and thought the menthol would help.

(note: 30 minutes is not enough if you have dark black hair).2 The color stays for about 8-9 months and lightens with time.3 After about 1-1.5 months of applying this hair color, I would suggest to use henna/mehendi for about 1 hour in all you hairs...which will not only nourish your hair, but also give very good result for highlighted hairs.4 Personal tip- If you are not satisfied with colored/highlighted hair and want to remove it, use anti-dandruff shampoo 3-4 times while washing your hair. Also the Godrej hair dye (black) available in powder sachet is also effective in removing the highlights.Cons:1 One sachet is not enough even for short hair. Purchase 2 sachets if you want proper results. (note: if you are a girl with shoulder length hair or more, I would suggest 3 sachets).2 Does not give too much highlighted effect if you want to get noticed from others with normal hair.3 Just like any other chemical hair color, it damages you hair and makes your hair rough.Verdict:It is ok to give this a try once if you want to color/highlight your hair at home. I would rather suggest spending few bucks and get your hair highlighted in parlor or salon for better results.If you find my review helpful, please click the YES/HELPFUL button! 👍', 'Best hair highlighter!

I had purchased mysore sandal soap few weeks back and perhaps due to this purchase amazon would have recommended this as well. Glad I clicked the suggestion and bought one of these! It's good bye to my existing Ponds Sandalwood talc !This review compares Mysore sandal talc vis-a-vis Ponds Sandalwood talcPros-1. The Fragrance is the first thing which hits you as soon as you open the bottle. Its smells pure authentic sandal wood than the perfumed ponds talc powder2. The mysore sandal talc allows you to decide the size of the hole you want to have on the bottle. Ponds one forces you to have 3 holes as soon as you want the top cover. I always hated this with the ponds talc. Ponds really wants you to use more than what you need!3. The fragrance last longer than the ponds sandalwood talc even though out the day! Believe it or not - you have to try one and be the judge!4. Some reviews talk about the powder not been finely powdered. Nothing like that - the powder is as fine as it's with Ponds sandalwood talc. No more no less!5. The bottle is sealed with a hologram sticker - that's assurance of genuine product from mysore sandal!6. Somehow I like the press-fit top of the bottle to keep the fragrance intact in the bottle when not in use! Ponds bottle was a twist to close top which is not really a seal tight way of shutting close the bottle7. Last but not the least- mysore sandal talc is 50% cheaper than Ponds sandalwood - why on earth would I ever buy Ponds again?Cons-None that i spotted yet\", 'Mysore Sandal is best talc ever in market.. Long-lasting fragrance increase body charm. And I can its Pure natural sandalwood talc. also its very economic talc but no compromise in quality.
